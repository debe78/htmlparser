Paris , 2 Sept . 1875
My dear Theo ,
This morning I heard from Pa and from you the news of Uncle Jan’s death . Such things make us say , ‘O Lord , join us intimately to one another and let our love for Thee make that bond ever stronger’ and ‘Fear God , and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man’ .
In the first crate of paintings going to Holland you’ll find a few lithographs and that engraving after Rembrandt . The two lithographs after Bonington will no doubt be to your liking . At the same time I’m sending a couple of photos for Pa of pictures by Jules Breton and Corot ; I’ll write ‘for Helvoirt’ on the back .
I’ve never heard of the painter Pynas you write about ; I’m eager to see the painting in question . Nor do I know that lithograph after Diaz , ‘A monk’ .
 
Last Sunday I was in the Louvre (on Sunday I often go either there or to the Luxembourg) ; I wish you could see the Van Ostade , his own family , himself , his wife and , I believe , 8 children , all in black , the wife and girls with white caps and neckerchiefs in a stately old Dutch room with a large fireplace , oak wainscoting and ceiling and whitewashed walls with paintings in black frames . In the corner of the room a large bed with blue curtains and blanket . Rembrandt’s ‘Supper at Emmaus’ , of which I wrote , has been engraved , Messrs G&amp ; Co . will publish the engraving in the autumn . Do you ever visit Borchers? It seems to me that his is a distinguished lady . Go out often , if you can , I mean of course to visit Caroline van Stockum , Carbentuses , Haanebeeks , Borchers &amp ; c . ; not to Kraft’s or Marda’s , you understand! Or it would have to be because you couldn’t do otherwise , just once or twice can do no harm .
How are things at the gallery? I know all about how it can be sometimes , but anyway , do whatever your hand finds to do .
And I wish you the very best , and write again soon . Ever ,
Your loving brother
Vincent
Herewith a note for Borchers . Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to all who ask after me . B . tells me that Weehuizen died , I didn’t know , were you there?
