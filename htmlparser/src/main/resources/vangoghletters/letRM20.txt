Letter|My dear Theo and dear Jo .
In normal circumstances I would certainly have already hoped for a brief line from you in these early days . But considering things as faits accomplis – my word – I think that Theo , Jo and the one are a little on edge and worn out – besides , I too am far from having arrived at some kind of tranquillity . Often , very often , I think of my little nephew – is he well? Jo will you believe me – if you again happen to have more children , which I hope , don’t have them in town , give birth in the country and stay there until the child is 3 or 4 months old . At present – it seems to me that although the child is no more than 3 months old yet , the milk is already becoming sparse , already you’re like Theo , too tired .
I don’t at all want to say exhausted , but anyway troubles are taking up too much room , are too numerous , and you’re sowing among thorns . That’s why I’d have you consider not going to Holland this year , the journey is always very , very costly and it has never done any good . Well yes , it does Mother good , if you like , as she’ll love to see the one – but she’ll understand and will prefer the little one’s well-being to the pleasure of seeing him . Besides , she won’t lose anything by it , she’ll see him later . But – without daring to say that it might be enough – whatever the case it’s certainly preferable that father , mother and child take an absolute rest in the country for a month .
On the other hand , I too greatly fear being confused – and find it strange that I shouldn’t know at all under what conditions I left – if it’s as before at 150 a month in three instalments – Theo didn’t arrange anything , and so to begin with I left in confusion .
 
Would there be a way of seeing each other again more calmly – I hope so . But the journey to Holland , I fear that it would be the last straw for all of us .
I still foresee that it makes the suffer later to be brought up in town . Does Jo consider that an exaggeration? I hope so , but anyway I believe that one must be prudent , though . And I say what I think because you well understand that I take an interest in my little nephew and care about his well-being ; since you really wanted to name him after me , I’d wish him to have a less anxious soul than mine . Which is foundering .
Let’s talk now about Dr Gachet . I went to see him the day before yesterday , I didn’t find him .
I’ve been very well the past few days , I’m working hard and have four painted studies and two drawings .
You’ll see a drawing of an old vineyard with a figure of a peasant woman . I’m planning to do a large canvas of it .
I think that we must in no way count on Dr Gachet . In the first place he’s iller than I am , it seemed to me , or let’s say just as much , there you have it . Now when one blind man leads another blind man , do they not both fall into the ditch?
I don’t know what to say . Certainly my last crisis , which was terrible , was due in considerable part to the influence of the other patients , anyway , the prison was crushing me , and ère Peyron didn’t pay the slightest attention to it , leaving me to vegetate with the rest , who were profoundly corrupted .
 
I can have lodgings , 3 small rooms at 150 a year . This if I don’t find better , and I hope to find better , is in any case preferable to the bedbug-infested hole at Tanguy’s , and besides I’d find a shelter myself there and could retouch the canvases that need it . In such a way the paintings will be less spoiled , and by keeping them in order the chance of deriving some profit from them would increase . For – I’m not talking about my own – but the Bernard , Prévost , Russell , Guillaumin , Jeannin canvases that ended up there – that’s not the place for them .
Now canvases like those – once again I’m not talking about my own – are merchandise which has and will retain a certain value , and neglecting it is one of the causes of our mutual financial embarrassment .
It rather saddens me to have to insist that you send me at least part of my month right at the beginning . But I’ll still do all I can to ensure that all goes well .
It’s certain , I think , that we’re all thinking of the one , and Jo must just say what she wants , I dare believe that Theo , like me , will go along with her opinion . Myself , all I can do at the moment is say that I think that we all need some rest . I feel – a failure – that’s it as regards me – I feel that that’s the fate I’m accepting . And which won’t change any more . But one more reason , setting aside all ambition , we can live together for years without ruining ourselves on either side . You see that with the canvases that are still in St-Rémy – there are at least 8 of them – and with the 4 from here , I’m trying not to lose my touch . That , though , is the absolute
  truth , it’s difficult to acquire a certain facility of production , and by ceasing to work I would lose it much more quickly , more easily than it cost me in troubles to acquire it . And the prospect darkens , I don’t see a happy future at all .
Write to me by return of post if you haven’t already written , and good handshakes in thought , I would hope that it might be possible to see each other soon with more rested minds .
Vincent .
