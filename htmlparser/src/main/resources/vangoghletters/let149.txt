Borinage Hainaut
My dear Theo ,
It’s time I write to you again , first of all to wish you happiness at the beginning of a new year . May much good be your share , and God’s blessing be on your work in this year that we’re beginning .
I’m eagerly longing for a letter from you , to hear again how things are going and how you are , also perhaps to hear if you have recently seen anything beautiful or remarkable .
As far as I’m concerned , you surely understand that there are no paintings here in the Borinage , that in general they haven’t the slightest idea of what a painting is , so it goes without saying that I’ve seen absolutely nothing in the way of art since my departure from Brussels . But this doesn’t mean that this isn’t a very special and very picturesque country , everything speaks , as it were , and is full of character . There was snow these last few days , the dark days before Christmas . Then everything was reminiscent of the medieval paintings by Peasant Bruegel , among others , and by so many others who were so good at expressing the singular effect of red and green , black and white . Time and again , what one sees here reminds one of the work of Thijs Maris or Albrecht Dürer , for example .
There are sunken roads here , overgrown with thorn-bushes and with old , twisted trees with their gnarled roots , which look exactly like that road in the etching by Dürer , The knight and Death .
These last few days , for instance , it was an extraordinary sight , with the white snow in the evening around the twilight hour , seeing the workers returning home from the mines . These people are completely black when they come out of the dark mines into the daylight again , they look just like chimney-sweeps . Their houses are usually small and could better be called huts , scattered along the sunken roads and in the wood and against the slopes of the hills . One sees moss-covered roofs here and there , and the light shines kindly in the evening through the small-paned windows .
 
Just as in Brabant we have the copse and the oak wood , and in Holland the pollard willows , so here one sees those black thorn-bushes around the gardens , fields and land . The recent snow gave it the effect of letters written on white paper , like the pages of the gospel .
I’ve already spoken here at various times , both in a fairly large room , specially furnished for religious meetings , and in the gatherings that are customarily held in the workers’ houses in the evenings , which one can best call Bible-reading . Spoke , among other things , on: the parable of the mustard seed , the barren fig tree , the man who was blind from his birth . On Christmas , of course , on the stable of Bethlehem , and Peace on earth .
May it come to pass with God’s blessing that I be placed here permanently somewhere ; I should sincerely wish it .
Everywhere around here one sees the big chimneys and the huge mountains of coal at the entrance to the mines , the so-called coal-pits . You know that large drawing by Bosboom , Chaudfontaine , it conveys the character of the land here well , only here everything is coal , in the north of Hainaut stone-quarries , and Chaudfontaine more iron ore .
I still think so often of that day when you were in Brussels and of our visit to the Museum . And I often wish that you were a bit closer and we could be together more often . Do write again soon . Again and again I look at that etching of A young citizen . The mine-workers’ language is not all that easy to understand , but they understand normal French well if one can speak it rapidly and fluently , then it naturally resembles their dialect , which is spoken amazingly fast . At a gathering this week I spoke on the text
  Acts XVI:9 ‘And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us . ’ And they listened attentively when I tried to describe what that Macedonian was like who needed and longed for the comfort of the gospel and the knowledge of the Only True God . How we should imagine him as a worker with signs of sorrow and suffering and fatigue on his face , without form or glory but with an immortal soul that has need of the meat which endureth unto everlasting life , namely the Word of God , for man cannot live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
How Jesus Christ is the Master who can strengthen , comfort and enlighten a man like the Macedonian , a workman and labourer who has a hard life . Because He himself is the great Man of Sorrows , who knows our diseases , who himself is called the carpenter’s son , even though He was the Son of God and the great physician of sick souls . Who worked for 30 years in a humble carpenter’s workshop to carry out God’s will ; and God wants man to live and walk humbly upon the earth , in imitation of Christ , minding not high things , but condescending to men of low estate , learning from the gospel to be meek and lowly in heart .
I’ve already had the opportunity to visit a few sick people , for many people here are ill . Wrote today to the president of the Comité d’Evangelisation to request that my case be brought before the next meeting of the committee .
It thawed last night , I cannot tell you how picturesque the hilly countryside looks in the thaw , now that the snow is melting and the black fields with the green of the winter wheat are again becoming visible . For foreigners the villages here are truly a maze , with countless narrow streets and alleyways with the small houses of the workers , at the foot of the hills as well as on their slopes and at the top . It can best be compared to a village like Scheveningen , especially the poor quarters , or to those villages in Brittany that we know from paintings . For that matter , you rode through this region yourself on the railway journey to and from Paris , and maybe remember it a little . The Protestant churches are small , similar to the one in Hoeven , but slightly larger , but where I spoke was only a simple , large room that can hold a hundred people if necessary . I also attended a service in a stable or barn , so it’s quite simple and novel .
Write soon when you have the time , and remember that you are repeatedly , even constantly , in my thoughts . Wishing again that God’s best blessings may be your share in the new year , and shaking your hand in thought , believe me ever
Your most loving brother
Vincent
Give my regards to everyone at Rooses’ and wish them all , and anyone who should happen to ask after me , a happy New Year .
If you write , please address your letter care of M . Vanderhaegen , Colporteur à Pâturages près de Mons (Borinage Haînaut) .
I just visited an old mother in a charcoal-burner’s family . She’s seriously ill , but pious and patient . I read a chapter to her and prayed with all of them . The people here have something special and appealing because of their simplicity and kind-heartedness , just like the Brabanters in Zundert and Etten .
