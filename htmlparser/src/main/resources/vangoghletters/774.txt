Paris , 21 May 1889
My dear Vincent ,
Thank you very much for your letter , Jo was also very pleased with the one you wrote to her . We were pleased to learn that your journey to St-Rémy went well , and that you feel calmer there than in Arles . All the same , I hope that your stay will only be for a short length of time , for having these mad people as your neighbours can’t be agreeable . What I would like is that we could discover some people
  somewhere who would take care of you while allowing you your entire freedom . That must be possible to find . If you didn’t fear returning to Paris or its surroundings , I would try to find somewhere like that for you to board .
Tell us in your next letter what the establishment you’re now in is like . How are you treated , is the food sufficient , and how are the people with whom you have to deal? Do you see something of the country? Above all , don’t wear yourself out , for it’s better that at present you do all you can to regain your strength . The work will come afterwards . A few days ago I received your consignment , which is very important , there are some superb things in it . Everything arrived in good order and undamaged . The Berceuse , the portrait of Roulin , the little sower , with the tree , the , the starry night , the sunflowers and the chair with the pipe and the tobacco are the ones I like best up to now .
  The first two , in particular , are most curious . Certainly it’s not the beautiful that is taught there , but there’s something in them that’s so striking and so close to the truth . Who tells us that we’re more right than the simple people who buy images in loud colours? Or rather , isn’t the charm they see in them as much a sensation evoked as when pretentious people look at the paintings in museums? Now in your canvases there’s a vigour which one certainly doesn’t find in chromos , in time that will become very fine as impasto , and certainly they’ll be appreciated one day . If we see that Pissarro , Gauguin , Renoir , Guillaumin don’t sell , one must be almost pleased not to have the public’s favour , since those who have it now won’t always have it , and the times could
  well change very soon . If you saw how weak the Salon and the World Exhibition are from the point of view of the paintings , you would , I think , be of the opinion that they won’t hold out for much longer . The Dutch school is doing very well there . There are two watercolours by J . H . Weissenbruch which I like most particularly , also some W . and J . Maris and Bosboom , Israëls and Breitner . One of the Weissenbruchs is a windmill beside a canal , blue sky with a little cloud which hides the sun . The other is a canal with boats one moonlit evening . He’s a forceful artist , that one , but Tersteeg says that he isn’t saleable . Lately I saw Gauguin , who is currently working on some sculpture . He wants to leave shortly for Pont-Aven , where De Haan is already . It appears that soon there will be an exhibition of the Independents , I would very much like to know what you think of that , and which canvases you think are the best to be exhibited . I’ve heard tell that everyone can exhibit 4 canvases , since there’s no room to admit any more . More soon , and write to us also when you feel like it . Good handshake
and ever yours ,
Theo
Warm regards from Jo .
