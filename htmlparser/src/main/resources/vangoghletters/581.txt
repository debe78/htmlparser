Letter|My dear Vincent ,
I wanted to write to your brother but I know you see each other every day and I’m afraid to trouble him , occupied as he is with business from morning till night .
I have left to work in Brittany (always the rage to paint) , and I had high hopes of having funds for that . The little I’ve sold went to pay off some pressing debts , and in a month I’m going to find myself with nothing . Zero
  is a negative power .
I don’t want to put pressure on your brother , but a brief word from you on this subject would set my mind at rest , or at least enable me to hold on . My God , how terrible these money matters are for an artist!
And if we have to make some reductions don’t worry , as long as I find some funds . I’ve just spent a fortnight in bed , struck down again by fever , and I’m getting back to work . If I can eke things out for
  5 or 6 months I think I’ll bring back some good canvases .
A word of encouragement in reply if possible .
Ever yours ,
Paul Gauguin
Pont-Aven , at Madame Gloanec’s
