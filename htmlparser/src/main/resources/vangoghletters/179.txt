My dear Theo ,
There’s something on my mind that I want to tell you . Perhaps you already know something about it , and what I’m telling you isn’t news .
I wanted to tell you that this summer I’ve come to love Kee Vos so much that I could find no other words for it than ‘it’s just as if Kee Vos were the closest person to me and I the closest person to Kee Vos’ . And — I said these words to her . But when I told her this , she replied that her past and her future were all one to her and so she could never return my feelings .
Then I was in an awful dilemma about what to do , to resign myself to that no , nay , never , or — not yet to regard the matter as over and done with , and to take courage and not give up yet .
I chose the latter . And until now I haven’t regretted that decision , even though I’m still confronted with that no , nay , never .
Since then , of course , I’ve suffered a great many ‘petty miseries of human life’ , which , if they were written down in a book , could perhaps serve to amuse some people , though they can hardly be considered pleasant if one experiences them oneself . Nonetheless , up to now I’ve been glad that I left the resignation or ‘how-not-to-do-it’ method to those who prefer it and , as for myself , plucked up a little courage . You understand that in cases like this it’s surprisingly difficult to know what one can , may and must do . But ‘wandering we find our way’ , and not by sitting still .
 
One of the reasons I haven’t written to you about it before now is that the position in which I found myself was so vague and undecided that I couldn’t explain it to you .
Now , though , we’ve progressed to the point where I’ve spoken about it — in addition to her — to Pa and Ma , to Uncle and Aunt Stricker and to Uncle and Aunt at Princenhage . The only one who said to me , though very informally and in private , that I did indeed have a chance if I worked hard and prospered , is one from whom I didn’t expect it at all , Uncle Cent . He was amused at the way I took Kee’s no , nay , never , i . e . by making light of it and sort of joking about it , bring no grist to Kee Vos’s mill of no , nay , never , for example , I wish her all good things , apart from hoping that the aforementioned flour-mill will go bankrupt . Likewise I didn’t much mind when Uncle Stricker said there was a danger I ‘would sever friendly relations and break old ties’ , to which I replied that in my opinion the case in question , far from breaking old ties , could renew the old ties where they were in need of repair . At any rate , I hope to go on like this and to keep well away from melancholy and pessimism . Meanwhile working hard , and since meeting her my work is going much better .
I said that now the situation is becoming somewhat clearer . First , Kee says no , nay , never , and furthermore I believe that I’ll have tremendous difficulty with the elders who already regard the matter as over and done with and will try and force me to give up . For the time being , though , I believe they’ll proceed with caution ,
  keeping me dangling and fobbing me off until Uncle and Aunt Stricker’s big celebration (in December) is over . Because they want to avoid scandal . After that , though , I fear that steps will be taken to get rid of me .
Forgive the rather harsh terms I’m using to make my position clear to you . I admit that the colours are a little harsh and the lines drawn a bit too hard , but it will nevertheless give you a clearer picture of the situation than if I were to beat about the bush . So don’t suspect me of lack of respect for those Elder persons .
Only I believe that they’re decidedly against it , and I want to make you see this . They’ll try and see to it that Kee and I can neither see nor speak nor write to one another , just because they understand very well that if we were to see , speak or write to one another there would be a chance of a change of heart in Kee . Kee herself thinks she‘ll never change her mind and , though the elder persons are trying to convince me that she can’t change , they fear that change nonetheless .
The elder persons will change their minds about this matter not when Kee changes her mind but when I become someone who earns at least 1 , 000 guilders a year . Again , forgive the hard contours with which I outline things . While I find little sympathy from the elders , I think that some of the younger ones will be able to understand my attitude . Perhaps you , Theo . Perhaps you’ve heard it said of me that I want to force the issue and suchlike expressions . But who doesn’t understand how senseless it is to try and force love! No , that’s far , far from my thoughts .
  But it’s not unfair or unreasonable to wish that Kee and I , instead of not being allowed to see one another , will see , speak and write to one another so that , getting to know each other better , we’ll be able to see for ourselves whether or not we’re suited to each other . A year of contact with one another would be beneficial for her and for me , yet the elders won’t budge on this point . If I were rich they’d talk altogether differently .
Yet by now you understand that I mean to leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to bring me closer to her , and I declare that
I shall love her so long
That in the end she’ll love me too .
The more she disappears , the more she appears .
Theo , aren’t you in love too , at times? I wish you were , for believe me , the ‘petty miseries’ of it are also of some value . Sometimes one is desolate , there are moments when one is in hell , as it were , but — it also brings with it other and better things . There are three stages , first not loving and not being loved , second loving and not being loved (the case in question) , third loving and being loved .
I’d say that the second stage is better than the first , but the third! That’s it .
Now , old boy , go and fall in love and tell me about it sometime . Keep quiet about the case in question and sympathize with me . I’d much rather have a yea and amen , of course , but meanwhile I’m really rather happy with my ‘no , nay , never’ . I consider that something , but older and wiser people say it’s nothing . Rappard was here , brought along watercolours that are becoming good . Mauve is coming soon , I hope , otherwise I’ll go to him . I’m drawing a great deal and think it’s getting better , I’m working much more with the brush than I used to . Now it’s so cold that practically all I do is draw figures inside , seamstress , basket-maker &amp ; c .
A handshake in thought , and write soon , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
They wanted me to promise not to say or write anything more on this subject , but I wouldn’t promise that ; no one in the world , in my opinion , can reasonably demand such a thing of me (or of anyone else in the same situation) . I’ve only given assurances to Uncle Cent that I would stop writing to Uncle Stricker for the time being , until unforeseen circumstances should make it necessary . A lark can’t help singing in the spring .
If you should ever fall in love and receive a no , nay , never , by no means resign yourself to it! But you’re such a lucky dog that something like this will probably never happen to you , I hope .
