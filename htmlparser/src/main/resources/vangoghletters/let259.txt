Letter|Saturday evening .
My dear Theo ,
Please accept my sincere thanks for your letter and the enclosure . As soon as I received your letter I bought seven guilders’ worth of paint in one go in order to have a supply in reserve and fill up the gaps . All this week we’ve had gales , storms and rain here , and I’ve been to Scheveningen many times to see it . And came back with two small seascapes . There’s already a lot of sand in the one , but with the second , when there really was a storm and the sea came very close to the dunes , I had to scrape everything off twice because of the thick layer of sand completely covering it . The wind was so strong that I could barely stay on my feet and barely see through the clouds of sand . I tried to get it down anyway by immediately painting it again in a small inn behind the dunes , after first scraping it all off , and then going out to take another look from there . So I have a couple of souvenirs after all . But another souvenir is that I’ve caught a cold again , with the results you know about , which now force me to stay at home for a few days . In the meantime I’ve painted some figure studies — I’m sending you two scratches .
Figure painting attracts me enormously , but it still has to ripen . I need to become better acquainted with the method — what is sometimes called ‘the cookery of art’ . In the beginning I’ll have to scrape off a great deal — and often make a new start – but I feel that I’m learning as a result , and that it gives me a new , fresh view of things .
When you next send , I’ll get some good sable brushes . They’re the proper drawing brushes , I find — for drawing a hand or profile in colour . For delicate tree branches , &amp ; c . they’re really essential , I find . The Lyon brushes , though fine , make lines and strokes that are too broad . My painting paper is almost finished too — by 1 Sept . I’ll also need to get some other items quite urgently , but I’ll manage with the usual .
 
Now I wanted to tell you that I entirely agree with various things in your letter . Above all , that I absolutely concur that Pa and Ma , with all their pros and cons , are people who are very rare in this day and age — and all the more so as time passes — and perhaps the new is by no means better — and whom one therefore ought to appreciate all the more . For my part I do indeed appreciate them , only I fear that what you have now reassured them about for the time being would come back , especially if they saw me again . They’ll never be able to grasp what painting is , never understand that a figure of a digger — a few furrows of ploughed land — a bit of sand , sea and sky , are serious subjects and so difficult , but so beautiful too that it’s well worth the trouble of devoting one’s life to depicting the poetry that’s in them . Also , whenever in the future , even more than now , they should see me slogging and toiling away at my work — scratching out and altering — now making a close comparison with nature , and then introducing a change so that they can no longer exactly recognize the spot or the figure , that will always be a disappointment to them . They’ll be unable to understand that painting isn’t done at a stroke , and they’ll always fall back on the idea ‘that I can’t really do it’ , and that real painters work in a totally different way .
In short , I dare not cherish any illusions and do fear that Pa and Ma will never take any real pleasure in it . This is hardly surprising and it’s not their fault — they haven’t learned to see as you and I have learned . They look at different things from us , and we don’t see the same things with the same eyes ; they don’t evoke the same thoughts .
To wish that it could be different is permissible , to expect it is in my view unwise .
 
They’ll find it difficult to understand my state of mind , and not know what drives me when they see me do things that seem strange and peculiar to them — will blame them on dissatisfaction , indifference or nonchalance , while the cause lies elsewhere , namely the desire , at all costs , to pursue what I must have for my work . Now they may be waiting expectantly for ‘painting in oils’ . Now it will come at last , and oh how disappointed they’ll be should they see it , I fear , seeing nothing but globs of paint in it . Besides , they regard drawing as a ‘preparatory study’ , a term I’ve detested for years and believe is as incorrect as possible . As you well know . And if they see me doing that just as much as in the past , they’ll think I’m still engaged in preparatory study . Well . But we’ll hope for the best and do our best to reassure them .
What you say about their new surroundings is most interesting . I certainly would like to try doing that kind of old church and churchyard with sandy graves and old wooden crosses .
I hope it will happen one day . You also write about a stretch of heath and a pine-wood nearby . Well , I have an everlasting nostalgia for heath and pine-woods with the curious figures . A woman gathering wood , a peasant fetching sand — in short , that simplicity that has something grand like the sea .
I always have in mind the idea of moving to the country if an opportunity arises , if circumstances suggest it .
Although I have an abundance of material here — the woods , the beach , the Rijswijk meadows close by , and thus literally a subject at every footstep . It would also be for the sake of living more cheaply . But at the moment there’s no particular reason , as far as I can see , so there’s no urgency .
I only mention it so that you’ll understand how attracted I am by a country district like the one you describe that’s Pa and Ma’s new home .
I’ve been made deeply happy by painting these last few days . I’ve really restrained myself and stuck to drawing , precisely because I know so many sad stories
  of people who threw themselves into it unprepared — they concentrated on method and woke up disillusioned , without having made any progress , and got deep into debt because of the expensive things they botched . From the start I felt a fear and horror of that — I regarded and still regard drawing as the only way of avoiding the same fate . And drawing has become dear to my heart , rather than being a burden . Now , though , almost unexpectedly , painting has given me lots of room , enables me to tackle effects that used to be out of reach , especially those I find , after all , most appealing , and it gives me so much more insight into many issues and new means of expressing effects , so that all this makes me deeply happy .
It’s been so beautiful at Scheveningen the last few days . The sea was almost more imposing before the storm than when the storm actually arrived . During the storm the waves were less visible and there was less the effect of furrows of ploughed land . The waves followed each other so quickly that each pushed the other aside , and the collision between these bodies of water produced a sort of foam like drifting sand that shrouded the foreground of the sea in a haze . But it was a nasty little storm — all the nastier — and all the more impressive the longer you looked , because it made so little noise . The sea was the colour of dirty dishwater . At that spot there was a fishing-boat , the last in the row , and several dark figures . There’s something infinite about painting — I can’t quite explain — but especially for expressing a mood , it’s a joy . In the colours there are hidden harmonies or contrasts which contribute of their own accord , and which if left unused are of no benefit . Tomorrow I hope to be able to go outdoors again .
I’ve also read Zola’s La faute de l’abbé Mouret and Son Excellence Eugène Rougon , also beautiful . I find Pascal Rougon , the doctor , a noble figure — he appears in various works , but always in the background . He is proof that , however corrupt a lineage may be , it’s always possible to overcome fate through willpower and principles . In his profession he found a strength that was greater than that of the nature he inherited from his family , and instead of giving in to his natural tendencies he followed a straight , clear path , and didn’t slip into the murky waters in which all the other Rougons drowned . He and Mme François in Le ventre de Paris are the most sympathetic figures to me . Well , adieu , I think of you often and would love to see you from time to time . Accept a handshake in thought , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
While writing this I’ve done another study of a boy , grisaille: charcoal , oil and very little colour , just for the tone .
