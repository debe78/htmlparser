Paris , 6 July 1875
My dear Theo ,
Thanks for writing , yes , old boy , I thought so . You must write and tell me sometime how your English is , have you done anything about it? If not , it’s not such a great disaster .
I’ve rented a small room in Montmartre which you’d like ; it’s small , but overlooks a little garden full of ivy and Virginia creeper .
I want to tell you which prints I have on the wall .
Ruisdael  	The bush
 	Bleaching fields
Rembrandt	 	Reading the Bible (a large , old Dutch room , (in the evening , a candle on the table) in which a young mother sits beside her child’s cradle reading the Bible ; an old woman listens , it’s something that recalls: Verily I say unto you , ‘for where 2 or 3 are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them’ , it’s an old copper engraving , as large as ‘The bush’ , superb) .
P . de Champaigne	 	Portrait of a lady
 
? Corot  	Evening
 
Bodmer	 	Fontainebleau
Bonington	 	A road
Troyon	 	Morning
Jules Dupré	 	Evening (resting place)
Maris	 	Washerwoman
 	A baptism
Millet	 	The four times of the day
 	 	(woodcuts , 4 prints)
Van der Maaten	 	Funeral in the cornfield
Daubigny	 	Dawn (cock crowing)
Charlet	 	Hospitality . Farmhouse surrounded by fir trees , winter scene with snow . A peasant and a soldier before a door .
Ed . Frère	 	Seamstresses
 	A cooper
Well , old boy , keep well , you know it , longsuffering and meek , as much as possible . Let us remain good friends .
Adieu
Vincent
