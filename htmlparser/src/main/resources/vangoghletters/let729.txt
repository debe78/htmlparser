Letter|My dear brother
I hope that Gauguin will also completely reassure you a little regarding painting matters.
I expect to start work again soon.
The charwoman and my friend Roulin had taken care of the house, put everything in good order.
When I come out I’ll be able to continue on my way here again, and soon the fine days will come and I’ll start on the orchards in blossom again.
I am, my dear brother, so heartbroken by your journey, I would have wished that you’d been spared that, for all in all no harm has come to me, and it wasn’t worth
  troubling you.
I can’t tell you how much it delights me that you’ve made peace and even more than that with Bongers. Say so on my behalf to André, and give him a very cordial handshake from me.
What wouldn’t I have given for you to see Arles in fine weather, now you have seen it when it’s dark.
However, be of good heart, send the letters directly to me, 2, place Lamartine. I’ll send Gauguin the paintings of his that are still at the house as soon as he wishes. We owe him the money he spent on the furniture.
Handshake, I must go back to the hospital again, but shortly I’ll leave for good.
Ever yours,
Vincent
Also write a line to Mother on my behalf, so that no one will be worried.
