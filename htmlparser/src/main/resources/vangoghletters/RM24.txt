Letter|Dear brother and ,
My impression is that as we’re all a little dazed , and moreover all working quite hard , it’s relatively unimportant to insist on having very clear-cut definitions of the position in which we find ourselves . You surprise me a little , seeming to want to force the situation , being in disagreement .
 
Can I do anything about it – perhaps not – but have I done something wrong , or anyway can I do something or other that you would like?
Whatever the case , again a good handshake in thought – and it nevertheless gave me a lot of pleasure to see you all again . Be very much assured of that .
Yours truly ,
V .
