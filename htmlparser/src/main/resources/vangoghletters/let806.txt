Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m dropping you another line to explain that 3 studies are missing from the consignment of canvases (which you will have already) , since by removing them the roll cost 3 . 50 francs less for carriage . So I’ll send them next opportunity – or rather they’re leaving today with other canvases – the following .
Wheatfield
Wheatfield and cypresses
ditto
The ivy
Study of cypresses
Reaper
ditto
The olive trees
then also the three studies mentioned below , Poppies – Night effect – Moonrise . Soon I’m sending you a few smaller canvases with the 4 or 5 studies I wanted to give to Mother and our . These studies are drying at the moment . It’s no . 10 and no . 12 canvases , reductions of the Wheatfield and cypresses , Olive trees , Reaper and Bedroom and a little portrait of me .
This will give them a good start , and I think this will give both you and me some pleasure to ensure that our sister or have a small collection of paintings . I’ll do reductions of the best canvases with them in mind , in this way I also wanted them to have the red and green vineyard , the pink chestnut trees , the night effect that you exhibited .
 
You’ll see that I’m gaining a little patience , and that persevering will be a result of my illness . I feel more detached from many preoccupations .
You’ll send me one day , when it suits you , the red vineyard and other canvases with that aim when you’ve seen the 5 that I’ve done .
Now for that reaper – at first I feared that the large format repetition that I’m sending you wasn’t bad – but afterwards , when the days of mistral and rain came , I preferred the canvas done from life , which appeared a little odd to me . But no , when the weather’s cold and sad , it’s precisely that one that makes me remember once again that summer furnace over the white-hot wheat , so the exaggeration isn’t as much as all that .
Père Peyron came back and chatted with me about seeing you , and said that no doubt your letter would tell me all the details of the conversation he’d had with you . That in any case the upshot was that it would be wise to go on waiting here . Which , also being my opinion , goes without saying .
Nevertheless , if an attack recurs I still want to try a change of climate , and even to return to the north as a stopgap .
 
Mr Peyron said that you looked as if you were well , which gives me pleasure .
I’ve received the 10 tubes of white , but as soon as possible I’ll need another dozen zinc white
 	 	 	 	Cobalt
 	, ,
, ,
Emerald
 	, ,
, ,
Chrome 1
 	 tube carmine
For there are fine autumnal effects to do .
At present I feel completely normal and no longer remember those bad days at all .
With work and very regular food this will probably last for quite a long time , so-so , and I’ll also do my work all the same without it appearing . For at the end of the month you’ll receive another dozen studies .
Am I mistaken , but it seems to me that your letter is very delayed this time?
Unfortunately there are no vineyards here , otherwise I’d promised myself to do nothing else this autumn . There are some , but for that I would have had to go and stay in another village .
 
On the other hand the olive trees are very characteristic , and I’m struggling to capture that . It’s silver , sometimes more blue , sometimes greenish , bronzed , whitening on ground that is yellow , pink , purplish or orangeish to dull red ochre .
But very difficult , very difficult . But that suits me and attracts me to work fully in gold or silver . And one day perhaps I’ll do a personal impression of it , the way the sunflowers are for yellows . If only I’d had some of them this autumn . But this half-freedom often prevents one from doing what one nevertheless feels able to do . Patience , however , you’ll tell me , and it’s indeed necessary .
Give my warm regards to Jo , look after yourself , and write soon please .
Handshakes .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
