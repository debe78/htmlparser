Letter|Paris, 29 Sept. 1875
My dear Theo,
Be careful, old boy, don’t lose your resilience.
See things as they are, and, for yourself, don’t think everything good.
One can deviate, both to the left hand and to the right hand. Remember what Pa no doubt once told you too: understanding and feeling must go together.
Warm regards and ever,
Your loving brother
Vincent
Write again soon.
 
I advised you to go out quite a lot, but if you don’t like it, don’t do it. You know that I didn’t go out so very much either, and that people often remarked upon it.
How much I’d like for us to be able to breakfast together or drink a cup of chocolate in my room. Keep well, old chap. Don’t take things that don’t concern you directly too much to heart, and don’t let them weigh upon you too heavily. How is it going, eating bread? Have you tried it yet? In haste, I shake your hand heartily in thought.
