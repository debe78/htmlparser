Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve just received your letter and the 50 francs enclosed , for which many thanks .
Enclosed are two small watercolours . As you know , when you were here you said that I should do my best to send you a drawing in the genre known as ‘saleable’ . You must forgive me , however , for not knowing exactly when a drawing may or may not be classed in this genre . I believe I used to be able to see this , but now I do realize daily that I get it wrong .
Well , I hope that the small bench , even if not yet saleable , will show you that I have nothing against tackling subjects with something agreeable or pleasant about them , which are thus more likely to find buyers than things with a more sombre sentiment .
I’m adding another to the small bench as a pendant , also a part of the woods .
I drew the bench after a larger watercolour that I’m working on in which the tones are deeper , but I don’t know whether I’ll succeed in carrying it out or completing it . The other was done after a painted study .
Now I’d very much like to hear from you whether in your view this little drawing is more or less in the spirit of what we discussed . I’m sending it to you because I wouldn’t like you to think that this wasn’t on my mind — but later I hope to send you something better .
 
You recall that in my last letter I wrote that I was going to that potato market . I brought back many croquis then , it was extraordinarily interesting . The politeness of the populace of The Hague towards painters is , however , demonstrated by the fact that a fellow behind me , or probably at a window , suddenly spat a wad of tobacco onto my paper — life can be very trying at times .
Well , there’s no need to take it personally , because these people aren’t malicious , but they don’t understand anything about it , and probably think someone like me mad when they see me doing a drawing with great scratches and lines which they can make nothing of .
Recently I’ve also been busy drawing horses on the street — I would like to have a horse pose sometime . Yesterday I heard someone behind me say: well , what kind of a painter is that? — he’s drawing the horse’s backside instead of doing him from the front . I rather enjoyed that comment .
I love it so much , sketching on the street , and , as I wrote in my last letter , I’m determined to achieve a certain standard in it .
Do you know an American periodical called Harper’s Monthly Magazine? – there are marvellous sketches in it . I don’t know it very well , I’ve only seen six months of it and have only 3 issues myself , but there are things in it I find astounding . Among them a glass-blower’s and an iron foundry , all kinds of scenes of factory work .
As well as sketches of a Quaker town in the old days by Howard Pyle .
 
I’m full of new pleasure in things because I have fresh hope of myself being able to make something with some soul in it .
What you write about the money that you lent and didn’t get back is certainly a disaster . From this I still have to pay for paint and buy a new supply , so by 20 Sept . I’ll definitely be running short . But I’ll vary the work a little and manage to get by . But remember that something extra will of course help me make extra progress — more successfully than otherwise . A great deal is required and everything’s expensive . But in any event I’m doubly grateful to you , and count myself more fortunate than many that things are as they are with the money , and I assure you I’m doing my best to make sure I make progress with it .
Today I’ll go to the ordinary Monday market again about the time they’re taking down the stalls to see if there’s something to sketch .
Adieu , good luck with everything . Do write again soon , and remember that I always greatly enjoy descriptions like the one of Montmartre .
 
There’s so much paint around that it has even got onto this letter — I’m working on the big watercolour of the bench . I hope it comes off , but the great problem is to retain detail with deep tone , and clarity is extremely difficult . Adieu again , a handshake in thought , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I thank you for sending while you yourself are so hard pressed .
I need it twice as badly , because the autumn goes so quickly and it’s the finest season to work in .
