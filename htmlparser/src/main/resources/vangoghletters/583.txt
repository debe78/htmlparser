Letter|My dear Theo ,
Now at long last , this morning the weather has changed and has turned milder — and I’ve already had an opportunity to find out what this mistral’s like too . I’ve been out on several hikes round about here , but that wind always made it impossible to do anything . The sky was a hard blue with a great bright sun that melted just about all the snow — but the wind was so cold and dry it gave you goose-pimples . But even so I’ve seen lots of beautiful things — a ruined abbey on a hill planted with hollies , pines and grey olive trees . We’ll get down to that soon , I hope . Now I’ve just finished a study like the one of mine Lucien Pissarro has , but this time it’s of oranges . That makes eight studies I have up to now . But that doesn’t count , as I haven’t yet been able to work in comfort and in the warm .
 
The letter from Gauguin that I had intended to send you but which for a moment I thought I had burned with some other papers , I later found and enclose herewith . But I’ve already written to him direct and I’ve sent him Russell’s address as well as sending Gauguin’s to Russell , so that if they wish they can make direct contact . But as for many of us — and surely we’ll be among them ourselves — the future is still difficult . I do believe in a final victory , but will artists benefit from it , and will they see more peaceful days?
I’ve bought some coarse canvas here and I’ve had it prepared for matt effects , I can now get everything , more or less , at Paris prices .
On Saturday evening I had a visit from two amateur painters ,
  one of whom is a — and also sells painting materials — and the other a justice of the peace who seems kind and intelligent .
Unfortunately I’m hardly managing to live more cheaply than in Paris , I need to allow 5 francs a day .
For the moment I haven’t found anything like a boarding-house , but there must surely be some .
If the weather also gets milder in Paris it will do you good . What a winter!
I daren’t roll up my studies yet because they’re hardly dry , and there are some areas of impasto that won’t dry for a while .
I’ve just read Tartarin sur les Alpes , which I greatly enjoyed .
Has that bloody man Tersteeg written to you? That’ll do us good anyway — don’t worry .
If he doesn’t reply , he’ll hear people talking about us all the same , and we’ll make sure he has nothing to fault in what we do . For example , we’ll send Mrs Mauve a painting in memory of Mauve with a letter as well from us both in which , if Tersteeg doesn’t reply , we won’t say a word against
  him but we’ll make it understood that we don’t deserve to be treated as though we were dead .
In fact , it’s likely that Tersteeg won’t be predisposed against us after all .
That poor Gauguin has no luck , I do fear that in his case convalescence will take longer than the fortnight he had to spend in bed .
For Christ’s sake , when are we going to see a generation of artists with healthy bodies? Sometimes I’m really furious with myself because it isn’t good enough to be iller or less ill than others , the ideal thing would be to have a strong enough constitution to live for 80 years and along with that , blood that was real good blood .
But we could take comfort if we felt that a generation of more fortunate artists was going to come along .
I wanted to write to you straightaway that I’m hopeful winter’s over now and I hope it will be the same in Paris . Handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
