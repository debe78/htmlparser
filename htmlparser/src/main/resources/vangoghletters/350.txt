Letter|My dear Theo ,
Wanted to tell you that Van der Weele saw my drawings this evening , his opinion was favourable and this gives me great pleasure . Do you know what I’ve done? Given the desirability of making some money if possible , I’ve sent small sketches of the two compositions to C . M . My hope is that this will perhaps result in his being ready to help carry out the whole of the plan I have , namely to do a series of drawings of work in the dunes .
I also thought that these drawings might perhaps be something for Cottier . I imagine they’d lend themselves to being placed , as one sometimes sees in England (and elsewhere too) , in the panels of a large cabinet , above a fireplace , in panelling , in short in woodwork . But you know how it is with Cottier: if there’s a certain degree of style in a drawing , he’ll be enthusiastic all right , but alas he usually pays little .
 
Still , he’s one of those who might give warm support , I believe , and moreover could provide a good place for the drawings . My idea is: could you show the croquis to friend Wisselingh sometime , and mention to him that I think they’d be good for setting in woodwork? Encourage him in any event to come to the studio if he’s ever in town . For supposing he thought they were suitable for this purpose , it might be possible to come to an arrangement with him for more , and if I knew he was interested I could perhaps make them even more suitable for that use if I worked specially at giving them a decorative character .
This morning I was out of doors at 4 o’clock already . My plan is to tackle the rag-pickers , or rather I’ve already begun tackling it . For this drawing I must do studies of horses , and today I did two in the Rijnspoor stable , and will probably get an old horse at the rubbish dump .
 
The scene at the dung-heap is splendid but very complicated and difficult , and will be a hard struggle . I did several drawings at a very early hour . One in which one has a view through to a very small , glittering spot of green freshness is likely to be the ultimate one , I think .
[sketch A]
It’s something like the above scratch ; everything , including the women in the foreground and the white horse in the background , must be in chiaroscuro against the green patch with a chink of sky above . So that one gets the opposition of all those sombre sheds overlapping each other in perspective , and all that rubbish and those grey figures against something clean and fresh . The group of women and the horse create lighter passages in the tone of the chiaroscuro , and the rag-pickers and the dung-heaps darker areas .
 
In the foreground all kinds of broken and discarded objects , bits of old baskets , a rusty street-light , broken pots &amp ; c . While making these first two drawings , so many ideas and such a strong desire to do yet more have come to me that I don’t know where to start . But finally I’ve concentrated on the dung-heap . Well , Theo , we must keep up our spirits , and see that we carry on toiling energetically .
Even if we’re anxious at times and don’t know how we’ll pull through , that is nothing and cannot be otherwise . Those who persevere often triumph .
And just now , when sending the money is beginning to be doubly hard for you , there may perhaps be a real chance to place something .
If only you were here . It also occurred to me that , were he not prejudiced against having anything to do with me , perhaps Tersteeg could make use of these compositions in a smaller format , with sepia for example .
If only you were here . Perhaps something could be arranged with him . I certainly don’t refuse to take the trouble to make something . As long as there’s no reconciliation with Tersteeg , however , and with C . M . , and I have virtually no other resource than the money from you , do your best , for it seems to me that , now especially , much depends precisely on my continuing to work hard . Although I have hardly anything left , I have again made an appointment with the models for this new drawing , and today I’ll perhaps get a Scheveningen hat and cape with what I still have at the moment .
If I can get hold of the patched cape , old chap , then I’ll have my female figures for the foreground of the drawing of the rag-pickers , I’m sure of that .
And it’s a start with looking for other female figures for Scheveningen drawings too .
