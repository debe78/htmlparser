Letter|My dear Theo ,
You’ll be busy with the Salon — I deliberately kept a stamp so that I could write to you again if need be .
I’ve written to friend Rappard , but no answer yet of course — in normal circumstances he sometimes waits a month before replying .
If you’re hard pressed , send less than the usual if need be , but send it as soon as possible .
 
I’ve made an appointment with Van der Weele to go painting in the dunes next week . He’s to explain some things I don’t yet know about .
I worked in the dunes these last few days but I long for a model , I can’t get on otherwise .
In short , I’m a little worried . So write as soon as possible — apart from that , I’m making fairly good progress with the work , and I believe you would approve of some of the drawings I’m working on .
I hope things go your way a bit , old chap — for I understand that things are
  difficult for you too . Good fortune with everything — adieu , I must start work — outdoors .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I’ll write to you in more detail about a few things soon . The appears to have something that’s connected to what I told you about her , it may be nothing , it may be something . I don’t know myself as yet , but I’m worried about this too . Write soon , old chap — for it’s very nasty to be completely broke . And makes small things become malignant sometimes .
