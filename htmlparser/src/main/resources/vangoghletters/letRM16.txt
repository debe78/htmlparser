Letter|My dear ,
Please write to my brother that he should maintain the prices for your paintings rather than offering them for less .
It’s no easier to sell them if they’re cheaper , nor is it more difficult to sell them for more , take my word for it , if you can sell them at all .
I hadn’t wanted to write you about this , preferring instead to talk to you at length about it .
I’m very busy at the moment: I’m working on half a dozen canvases of 30 square , to be used to decorate the house . There are three canvases of the public garden , 4 . ploughed fields [x] [the starry night [?]]
