Letter|Scheveningen .
Holland’s coasts are hidden by ranges of dunes that deprive the traveller of the sight of the waters . After a long and arduous climb up these sandy hills , raise your eyes , and there’s the sea! This North Sea was poorly known to the ancients , who imagined it in terms of fables and superstitious terrors . Even Tacitus pictured it as being churned up by constant winds and inhabited by monsters . The fact is that its coasts are stormy , and its colour is variable ; in the foreground it is a scummy yellow that looks like dirty washing water , further off , a weak green , and in the distance , a faded blue that blends into the wavy line of the sky . Here and there , great clouds cast their sombre shadows obliquely over this indistinct mirror . No rocks , no cliffs break the force of the waves: this sea rolls on its sandy bed , which it had made for itself and which it is constantly expanding . The physiognomy of Holland’s coasts varies very little: sand , and more sand , water and more water , sky and more sky . On these coasts , which give the impression of being limitless , there stand , between the mouth of the Maas and Den Helder , a number of fishing villages . The most interesting of these villages is Scheveningen . The beach at Scheveningen is frequented by bathers during the summer . At that time of year , a pretty village , linked with The Hague by a tree-lined road , and a promenade built of timber that disappears among the dunes , welcomes foreigners from every country . Here everything shows the effects of proximity to the Ocean . The church , which by no means lacks elegance , contains the enormous skull and a few vertebrae of a sperm whale that was cast up on the shore in a storm , in 1617 . These silent fragments are like a commentary on these words of Job: “The monsters proclaim Thee , O Lord” . In the main street , which leads to the sea , are to be found several vendors of shellfish . This sea , whose voice can be heard , shows itself only when the traveller’s feet are almost at the water . The sudden delight of surprise , and the grandeur of the scene that then opens up , fully compensate for the gradation of effects found on other shores . A fishing fleet , whose smacks are beached on the sand , or riding at anchor , or scattered out at sea like the thoughts of the sea’s brain , associates the image of labour with historical memories . Here the Ocean must be proud of Holland and the Dutch ; in 1673 , De Ruyter defeated the English and French fleets within sight of Scheveningen .
  This little village is Holland’s Cherbourg . It has seen exiles and royal misfortunes . It was a cold January day in 1795 ; the fishermen were loading two boats with packages and travelling trunks ; from a conveyance that appeared at the far end of the village came a man enveloped in a wide cloak and a woman carrying a child in her arms . That man was the Prince of Orange ; the child was the grandson of the last Stadholder , the future King William II . In 1813 , this shore once again saw and welcomed amid acclamations (the Empire had just fallen) the representative of that same family that now occupies the throne of the Netherlands .
If you continue your walk along the sands to the right you will find the spa hotel , where people from The Hague come on Sunday evenings to listen to music . At nightfall , when the sea steals from the sky all its stars , it is a solemn and magnificent prospect . I have seen , in front of this hotel , a display of fireworks on the water , whose subject was , of course , the burning of a ship . I am not especially fond of rockets or Roman candles , but in this case the vulgarity of such entertainments was redeemed by its theatrical grandeur . The darkling sea was almost in itself worth the whole cost of the performance , and with its sublime din , with those tattered clouds , with the only too real catastrophes which the imagination could picture to itself in this pretended conflagration , the scene by no means lacked majesty . And yet this main street , these baths , these cafés , these hotels – all of that is not Scheveningen . A person may have spent many summers in this place and yet not know the fishing village at all . Behind some elegant dwellings , which are a true example of trompe l’oeil , are hidden narrow streets , and poor brick hovels , in which a silent and wretched population conceals itself . At the doors of these poky cubby-holes , in front of which are drying washing , nets , red shirts and strings of fish threaded on a line , there appears from time to time the figure of a woman , sad , aged and wasted by fever . Children play in the midst of all this wretchedness , as if it were one of the privileges of their age to be unaware of misfortune and poverty . The population of Scheveningen is 6 , 800 , of whom only 450 are Catholics . It should be noted that the majority of the innkeepers and fish merchants profess the Catholic faith , whereas the shipowners and the fishermen are Protestants . For the village there are two government schools , which we visited and which are kept in perfect order . The first , if truth be told , is a ward in an asylum , which holds 250 children of both sexes .
  The children leave this first school at the age of about six , and then enter the primary school , which has 500 pupils . Teaching is shared among a head , five assistant masters and five monitors . The children are taught reading , writing , arithmetic , geography and a little history . They leave this second school at between ten and twelve years of age: the boats claim them . The fishermen’s language is a kind of patois that is fundamentally different from ordinary Dutch , and in which some linguists have believed they recognize traces of the Anglo-Saxon that seems to have been the source of the national language . Their dress , especially the women’s , is distinctive . In the winter , they wear a bodice of serge or calico , a brown serge skirt , a long cape of the same stuff and the same colour , lined in red , with a tall , stiff collar . There is something austere and monkish about this form of clothing ; one must in any case admit that it is well suited to the climate and to their occupation . A large hat of coarse straw with a border of black ribbon , lined in flower-printed calico , bent slightly downward on either side and rising at the back and the front like a boat , enables them to hold up to three or four baskets on their heads . These women are tall , and robustly built , with rather plain but healthy-looking faces , blue eyes with somewhat drooping lids , and sturdy limbs . By the age of thirty they have already lost much of their freshness ; their skin is weather-beaten , a condition due , no doubt , to the proximity of the sea and to their living in the dunes . The dunes form a country within the country itself ; the sand reflects the sun’s rays more strongly than elsewhere ; this is Holland’s Arabia .
The men are comparatively short in stature ; their dress – black jacket and trousers – does not suit their bearing , which is serious , but awkward . They have round faces , short necks , usually brown and curly hair . Their great treasures are their shirt-buttons and the silver buckles which they attach to their feet and their belts . This conservatism in their dress , especially the women’s , this consistency in their physical traits , these racial characteristics that are preserved due to the concern shown by the boys and girls of Scheveningen to marry only amongst themselves , are all , perhaps , a consequence of their dealings with the sea . The Ocean , in which some poets have believed they have seen an image of inconstancy , is , on the contrary , an image of eternity ; of all the elements , it is the one that has suffered the fewest vicissitudes since the beginning of the world .
 
The dawn of creation saw it born thus , and thus it still rolls today . It moves , it does not change . The Ocean sets its ever-moving stability against the forces of time that undermine the rocks , that alter the level of the continents , that transform living nature and human destinies . The ways of the fishermen who live on the coast share the nature of the Ocean . They have none of the habits of the city . The essence of their character is independence . It seems that dealings with the sea foster in them the sense of human dignity . These men have no love of the land ; they need space , the free vastness of the seas , the untamed flood , the sky , blue by day , full of stars by night , the sharp north wind , the mind of a man standing upright in his actions like the ship’s mast upon the movements of the Ocean . Soldiers of toil , they love deliberately to brave the lightning’s bolt , the whinnying of the waves that run , without a bit and foaming at the mouth , about the boat’s keel . On land , they are homesick . Strangers to social conventions , they wish to be neither governed nor protected . This feeling of independence can be seen on their faces . Sailors and fishermen differ from other men in the way they carry their heads high as they walk . One would at the very least say that for them was written Ovid’s line: He gave man a face that looks at the sky .
This love of liberty even rubs off on their religious beliefs . As we have seen , all , or almost all , of the fishermen of the coast are Protestant ; they acknowledge only two books that have the right to speak to them of God: the Bible and the sea . It appears that the Ocean exerts a moral and sanctifying effect on them . Drunkenness is rare among the fishermen of Scheveningen , but even those who drink Hollands gin to excess on land abstain from any form of intemperance when they are at sea . Swearing is unknown on board a boat . The seafaring life strengthens and increases religious feelings in these simple and ignorant men . When a fishing boat sails , each fisherman takes his Bible with him . A meal is never eaten without grace being said , and is also followed by a prayer of thanks . On Sunday , if the men are at sea , they abstain from fishing , and if they are on land , the singing of the Psalms can be heard in their little houses from morning onwards .
