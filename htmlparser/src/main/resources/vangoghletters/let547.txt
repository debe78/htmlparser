Letter|My dear Theo ,
Just wanted to write and tell you that I’ve pressed ahead with models . I’ve made two fairly large heads by way of a trial for a portrait .
Firstly that old man I already wrote to you about — a type of head in the style of V . Hugo’s — then I also have a study of a woman .
In the woman’s portrait I’ve introduced lighter tones in the flesh , white tinted with carmine , vermilion , yellow , and a light background in greyish yellow , from which the face is separated only by the black hair . Lilac tones in the clothes .
Rubens is certainly making a strong impression on me . I find his drawing immensely good , by which I mean the drawing of heads and hands in themselves . I’m utterly carried away , for instance , by his way of drawing the features in a face with strokes of pure red or , in the hands , modelling the fingers with similar strokes . I go to the museum quite often and then look at little else but a few heads and hands by him and Jordaens . I know that he isn’t as intimate as Hals and Rembrandt , but those heads are so alive in themselves . I probably don’t look at the ones that are most generally admired . I look for fragments such as those blonde heads in St Theresa in Purgatory .
 
I’m also looking for a blonde model just because of Rubens .
But you mustn’t take it too much amiss of me when I tell you that I can’t manage on my money for this month .
I’ve bought some more paint and two new types of drawing brush which I’m extremely pleased with and with which I can work more accurately . Then the canvases I brought with me were too small for the heads , since using other colours means I need more room for my surroundings . All this and the models are ruining me .
I’m telling you this as urgently as possible , because if one has to lose time , one loses double .
Towards the end of the month , when I’ve done a few more heads , I hope to make a view of the Scheldt , which I’ve also got a canvas for . If the weather’s bad I can go into an inn at St Anne , which is right opposite the rise where the Church of Our Lady is . Other painters have been there before .
 
I’m very glad to have come here , because it’s useful and necessary for me for many things . I’ve made the acquaintance of Tyck , the best paint manufacturer here , and he was very obliging in giving me information about some colours . The greens that persist , for example . For instance , I asked him things about Rubens’s technique , to which he replied in a way that proves to me that he analyzes well , which is doing something that not everyone thinks of , and which is nonetheless a very useful thing . Now what else shall I tell you? Oh yes — I’ve seen two collections of modern paintings . Firstly what was bought at the exhibition for the lottery , and then a collection of paintings that was sold . That’s why I saw various fine things , two studies by Henri de Braekeleer , you know that he has nothing to do with the old De Braekeleer , I mean the one who’s a famous colourist and analyzes rigorously — Manet-like , at any rate as original as Manet . One was a woman in a studio or other interior with Japanese objects , the woman had on a costume , yellow and black . Flesh colour , white and carmine . All sorts of strange little tones in the surroundings .
The other was a half-finished study of a landscape .
  Flat , faded yellow fields as far as the eye could see , a black cinder road with a canal alongside it crossing them . Above a sky of lilac , grey , with accents of carmined lilac . Far distant a small red (vermilion) note of a roof and two little black trees . So nothing , and yet I found a lot because of the singular feeling for contrasting colours . I also saw an old study by Degroux , Woman by a cradle , something like an old Israëls . What else shall I tell you about these new paintings? I think many of them very fine , and by that I mean precisely the work of the Colourists or those who try to be , who look for mother-of-pearl-like combinations everywhere in the lights . Only for me , it’s by no means always that — it’s too contrived and I’d rather see a simple brushstroke and a less contrived , less difficult colour . More simplicity , in a word that knowledgeable simplicity which isn’t afraid of frank technique . I like Rubens precisely because of his straightforward manner of painting , his working with the simplest means .
I don’t count Henri de Braekeleer among those seekers of mother-of-pearl everywhere , for with him it’s a strange , a very interesting endeavour to be literally true , and he stands very much on his own .
Also saw various grey paintings , among others a printer’s workshop by Mertens , a painting by Verhaert of his own studio , where he sits etching and his wife stands behind him , De la Rivière , an Amsterdam undertaker after the funeral — very fine in the blacks , a Goya-like conception — that tiny little painting was masterly .
Landscapes and Seascapes — saw very fine ones — in both collections .
 
But as regards paintings — it’s the fisher boy by Frans Hals , Rembrandt’s Saskia , a number of countenances by Rubens , smiling or weeping , that come most to my mind .
Ah — a painting has to be painted — and why not simply? If I look at life itself now — I have similar impressions . I see the people in the street — very well — but I often find the servant girls so much more interesting and beautiful than the ladies — the labourers more interesting than the gentlemen . And I find a power and vitality in those common girls and fellows which , to express them in their singular character , would have to be done with a firm brushstroke , with a simple technique .
Wauters understood that , at one time anyhow , for I saw nothing by him this time .
What I find so fine about Delacroix is precisely that he reveals the liveliness of things , and the expression and the movement , that he is utterly beyond the paint .
And — well — many of the fine things I saw — although I think they’re good , often it’s much too much paint .
At the moment I’m getting more and more accustomed to talking to the models while I’m painting , so as to keep the liveliness in their faces .
I’ve discovered a woman who formerly — she’s old now — when living in Paris — provided models for painters , for Scheffer , Gigoux , Delacroix , she says for instance , and to another one who was painting a Phryne . Now she’s a washerwoman and knows a lot of women , and would always be able to provide them , she says .
It has snowed , and first thing this morning the city was beautiful in the snow — splendid groups of street-sweepers .
 
It’s a good thing I came , because I’m already full of ideas — for when I’m back in the country , too . I read an article by E . Bataille , I think it was in L’Etoile Belge , reprinted from Le Figaro , about the situation in Paris , an article that gave me the impression of being very sound , but according to him affairs in general are really bad . In Amsterdam , contrary to the opinion of Dutch journalists , this Mr Bataille also expressed himself pessimistically about the state of affairs in Holland . As far as the art trade is concerned — here , as I already wrote , the dealers are complaining — sheer destitution . And yet — I believe that so much more might still be done .
To mention just one thing — in the cafés , the restaurants , the cafés chantants — one sees no paintings , at least as good as none . And how this goes against nature! Why aren’t there any still lifes hanging there , in the way Fijt , Hondecoeter , so many others made splendid decorations in the old days? Why — if girls are what they want — no portraits of women? I know that one has to work cheaply for such purposes , but one can work relatively cheaply . Pushing the prices high is the ruin of the trade and makes it as quiet as the grave . Anyway .
Regards , do write again between times if you will .
As to the money , do what you can , but know this , that we have to do our utmost to succeed . And I’m not abandoning my idea of the portraits , because it’s a cause worth fighting for to show people that there’s something else in human beings besides what the photographer is able to get out of them with his machine . Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
I’ve noticed the many photographers here , who are much the same as everywhere and apparently have plenty to do .
But always the same conventional eyes , noses , mouths , waxy and smooth and cold .
It still always remains dead .
And painted portraits have a life of their own that comes from deep in the soul of the painter and where the machine can’t go . The more photographs one looks at , it seems to me , the more one feels this .
