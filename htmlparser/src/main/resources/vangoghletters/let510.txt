Letter|My dear Theo ,
Since it’s Sunday today , I wanted to write to you again . Because I’ve neglected to say anything about the painting by Uhde , Suffer the little children to come unto me . Yes — I think it’s good — but new — it isn’t . I like interiors in bright tones with peasant children — without a mystical figure of Christ , like Israëls , like Artz , better than this , where one gets a mystical Christ into the bargain . The children are very fine characterizations — but are they better than those by Lobrichon , Frère or even Knaus , Vautier , as they used to be in their heyday?
Don’t think that this isn’t saying much , because all those fellows that I mention were extraordinarily clever character artists , particularly in the past .
What I have against the Uhde painting is that there’s something cold in it , like in the new brick houses and schools and Methodist churches .
And — forgive me — despite the great merits of everything in the painting , it makes me nostalgic for Decamps’s or Isabey’s less orthodox manner of painting .
In short , there is in the end something consumptive about it , and I think a Corot , a Dupré , a Millet is so infinitely more healthily painted .
 
I’m only speaking about it on the basis of the reproduction , though ; I consider it quite possible that if I saw the painting I would become more reconciled to it as far as the technique is concerned . You know how much I like those bright fellows too — but — you see — it goes too far , and Mantz puts it very well — he says , those who are always dreaming of the maximum of bright colours everywhere will find Mr Harpignies’ greens of a rather blackish intensity .
So you see: that they start to regard every effect against a strong and coloured light , every shadow , as heresy — that they never seem to go for a walk very early in the morning , or in the evening at sunset , that they don’t want to see anything but midday light or gaslight , and that has to be electric!
No — the effect of all this on me is that I sometimes catch myself longing to see things — well , for example , like Nuijen’s moving day , such as an old Leys , such as a Cabat — a Diaz , Lepoittevin .
 
Perhaps you see nothing in this but my constant contrariness .
But still I say first of all — that I think Uhde’s painting very good — only after I’ve thought it good , the aftertaste is far from entirely pleasant — at least not very encouraging in that these painters don’t usually get better in later paintings .
Anyway — it really is a painting for the house of G&amp ; Cie , of their best . They also had Knaus at G&amp ; Cie , and Lobrichon too . I assure you that I don’t discard all that as a matter of course — far from it . Does it express what I mean when I put it like this: it’s a good painting from Messrs Goupil &amp ; Cie? Does it express what I mean when I say: lots — but lots of talent , as much as possible — but genius? — no . This painting of Uhde’s — is much more German (see how cleverly Mantz pokes fun at Meyerheim , ‘still-life dauber’ in his article , did you notice that?) , is , I say , much more German that it seems .
Oh those wise , those new , those know-it-all people of the new progress who criticize Harpignies! I wager that you can’t stand that either — and in content they’re a new edition of Monnier’s M . Prudhomme .
To speak of something more encouraging — I enclose a woodcut after Clausen , who started out fairly German but has got the better of his weaknesses ,
  just as Neuhuys also often gets the better of his . Here you are — this is why I enclose the print for you — here at last is something from English art that reminds me of work by Pinwell and Fred Walker . It’s different again from Millet — but you’ll see that , although you may look at it for a long time , it doesn’t become boring .
Don’t get rid of the print , because one so seldom sees any of this rare art , which one shouldn’t confuse with Bridgman , say . And the other print , less manly as regards the conception , is mightily good as regards sentiment , and also really original .
I’m working hard on figure drawings every day . I must have at least a hundred , though — or even more , before I can stop again . I’m trying to find something different from my old drawings , and to find the character of the peasants — especially those from round here .
And we’re heading towards harvest — and then I must make the wheat harvest and the potato lifting a campaign time . It’s twice as difficult to get a model then and yet it’s essential , because the older I get , the more convinced I become that one can’t be too conscientious , that one must always and eternally exert oneself in what Daudet (in L’histoire de mon livre , an article by him that I read recently about Les rois en exil) calls the hunt for the model .
I would also like to show Serret the studies of the harvest . So I don’t know exactly when I’ll be able to send the portfolio of studies from the model . But before too long , anyway . And I’ll also send another 3 cottages or so — painted studies like the last ones — before the harvest , I hope . Am I mistaken in thinking that there’s something good in the old tower? Have you already varnished it? They’re both dry enough for a coat of varnish now , and really need it because there’s something else under both of them . Do you already have some sort of estimate of when you’re coming? And aren’t there any new Lhermitte? Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
I say again that there are examples , only too many , by the very bright fellows , where they later become chalky or oily . It’s because I’ve observed this so often that I have certain reservations , can’t think the Uhde painting entirely good . The two blacksmiths by Raffaëlli are very fine .
