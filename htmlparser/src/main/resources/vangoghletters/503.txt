My dear friend!
It gave me great pleasure to receive a sign of life from you again , even if that sign wasn’t entirely as I’d have wanted it to be .
The news of the death of your came so unexpectedly that I very much wanted some further message , which didn’t come , however . If I remember rightly , my superficial manner of reading newspapers , where the advertisements always go by the board , was the only reason that I didn’t learn the news from the Nieuws van den Dag
  first . At any rate , I know that very , very shortly after receiving the formal announcement , I called on a friend who had already read it in the newspaper!
Did you think that I had so little interest in your or in the events in your family that a common polite formula to announce something so affecting was enough for that interest?
Then you were seriously mistaken .
In connection with what you’ve now sent me , I return briefly to your last letter , in which you talk about the art of expressing oneself well in words .
I wanted to point out to you that , poorly as may I do it verbally , I can do it well
  in writing , if I take pains . What I wrote to you about your manner of working expresses exactly what I think — even though I didn’t in fact take very great pains with that , but the only consequence has been a less beautiful style! I hoped and I still hope that I’m mistaken in my opinion of your manner of working ; but for this very reason I’m really sorry to have to see in what you’ve now sent me so complete a confirmation of my opinion that I myself was shocked by it .
You’ll agree with me that such work isn’t intended seriously .
You can do better than this — fortunately ; but why , then , observe and treat everything so superficially? Why not study the movements? Now they’re posing .
  That coquettish little hand of that woman at the back , how untrue! And what connection is there between the coffeepot , the table and the hand lying on top of the handle? What’s that pot doing , for that matter ; it isn’t standing , it isn’t being held , but what then? And why may that man on the right not have a knee or a belly or lungs? Or are they in his back? And why must his arm be a metre too short? And why must he lack half of his nose? And why must the woman on the left have a sort of little pipe stem with a cube on it for a nose?
And with such a manner of working you dare to invoke the names of Millet and Breton? Come on! Art is too important , it seems to me , to be treated so cavalierly .
Adieu , believe me ever
Your friend
