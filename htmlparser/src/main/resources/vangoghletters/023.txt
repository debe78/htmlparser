Letter|London , 16 June 1874
My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter .
I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday , 25 or Saturday , 27 June , if nothing unforeseen happens . I’m longing so much to see everyone and Holland . I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art , start thinking about any questions you might want to put to me .
We have many beautiful things here , including a spirited painting by Jacquet , and a beautiful Boldini .
 
There are beautiful things at the Royal Academy this year ; among others Tissot has 3 paintings .
I’ve been drawing again recently , but it was nothing special .
I was glad to see in your letter that you visit Haanebeeks .
Adieu , goodbye for now , give my regards to all my friends . Ever ,
Your brother .
Vincent .
I’m glad you like César de Cock so much ; he’s one of the few painters to have understood our Brabant intimately enough . I don’t know whether I told you that I met him last year in Paris .
