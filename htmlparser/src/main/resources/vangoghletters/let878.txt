Letter|Dear Mother ,
Thank you very much for your last letter , which I haven’t answered yet . Wil told me that you’d been to Nuenen again , which I can understand so very well , and am already longing to hear from you how you found things there and visited old friends . Time passes quickly , although some days drag . And it was with much interest that I heard that Wil’s been working in the Walloon hospital . I didn’t actually intend to go back to Paris again ; I would have stayed there another year had it not been that the last time I wasn’t well I definitely had to attribute it in part to the effect that other people’s illness had on me . Why I decided that it was time to change surroundings , if I wanted to preserve my capacity for work , such as it is , and what remains to me of common sense . I wrote that to Dr Peyron this very day . I’d had words with him about it , but we still parted on good terms , and he’d asked Theo for news of me . I was very fond of him , and for his part he made a distinction to my advantage between me and others of his patients .
 
And it’s the case that if I ever wanted to go back it would be as if I were with friends .
But the pleasure of seeing Theo again and meeting Jo , who seems to me sensible and warm-hearted and uncomplicated , and my new namesake , and further to be back among painters and immersed again in all the conflict and discussion and above all work in the painters’ little world of their own , all this distraction has a favourable effect , it seems to me , in so far as the symptoms of the malady (which are like its thermometer) have disappeared altogether recently — although I’ve learned that one may not make too much of that .
The here has been very kind to me ; I can go to his home as often as I like , and he’s very well informed about what’s going on among painters these days . He’s very nervous himself ; most probably that hasn’t improved since his ’s death . He has two children , a of 19 and a of 16 . He tells me that in my case working is still the best way to keep on top of it .
 
Well , in the last fortnight or 3 weeks that I was in St-Rémy I worked from early in the morning until the evening without stopping . And only stayed in Paris for a few days , and got started again straightaway here .
Theo was waiting for me at the station , and my first impression was that he looked paler than when I left . But talking to him and seeing how he was at home , I was encouraged — although he was coughing — but it really is true that he has not got worse during that time . So even if it were to remain the same , I would almost dare believe that this might already be counted as something gained . And next year he’ll get stronger rather than weaker . It’s a matter of patience , his constitution and the circumstances of his life .
I heard some details about Cor from them . Give him my warmest regards when you write and tell him that I’m back again . I’d write to him , but it’s such a very different profession , his and mine .
Theo’s holidays are approaching and so you’ll be seeing them again quite soon .
  They’re also planning to come here for a couple of days , because we only saw each other briefly and hurriedly .
It’s cripplingly expensive in the village here , but Gachet , the doctor , tells me it’s just the same in all the villages around here , and he’s really feeling the pinch himself compared with before . And to start with I need to stay close to a doctor whom I know . And I can pay him in paintings , and I wouldn’t be able to do that with somebody else , should something happened so that I needed his help .
Well , I’ll say goodbye now because I have to go out . Hoping that you and Wil will receive this in good health , and embraced in thought .
Your loving
Vincent .
