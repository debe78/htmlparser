Letter|My dear old Bernard ,
More and more it seems to me that the paintings that ought to be made , the paintings that are necessary , indispensable for painting today to be fully itself and to rise to a level equivalent to the serene peaks achieved by the Greek sculptors , the German musicians , the French writers of novels , exceed the power of an isolated individual , and will therefore probably be created by groups of men combining to carry out a shared idea .
One has a superb orchestration of colours and lacks ideas .
The other overflows with new , harrowing or charming conceptions , but is unable to express them in a way that’s sufficiently sonorous , given the timidity of a limited palette .
Very good reason to regret the lack of an esprit de corps among artists , who criticize each other , persecute each other , while fortunately not succeeding in cancelling each other out .
You’ll say that this whole argument is a banality . So be it — but the thing itself — the existence of a Renaissance — that fact is certainly not a banality .
 
A technical question . Do give me your opinion in next letter .
I’m going to put the black and the white boldly on my palette just the way the colourman sells them to us , and use them as they are .
When — and note that I’m talking about the simplification of colour in the Japanese manner — when I see in a green park with pink paths a gentleman who’s dressed in black , and a justice of the peace by profession (the Arab Jew in Daudet’s Tartarin calls this honourable official shustish of the beace) , who’s reading L’Intransigeant .
Above him and the park a sky of a simple cobalt .
Then why not paint the said shustish of the beace with simple bone black and L’Intransigeant with simple , very harsh white?
Because the Japanese disregards reflection , placing his solid tints one beside the other — characteristic lines naively marking off movements or shapes .
In another category of ideas , when you compose a colour motif expressing , for example , a yellow evening sky —
 
The harsh , hard white of a white wall against the sky can be expressed , at a pinch and in a strange way , by harsh white and by that same white softened by a neutral tone . Because the sky itself colours it with a delicate lilac hue .
Again , in this very naive landscape , which is meant to show us a hut , whitewashed overall (the roof , too) , situated in an orange field , of course , because the sky in the south and the blue Mediterranean produce an orange that is all the more intense the higher in tint the range of blues —
The black note of the door , of the window panes , of the little cross on the rooftop , creates a simultaneous contrast of white and black
just as pleasing to the eye as that of the blue with the orange .
To take a more entertaining subject , let’s imagine a woman dressed in a black and white checked dress , in the same primitive landscape of a blue sky and an orange earth — that would be quite amusing to see , I imagine . In fact , in Arles they often do wear white and black checks .
In short , black and white are colours too , or rather , in many cases may be considered colours , since their simultaneous contrast is as sharp as that of green and red , for example .
 
The Japanese use it too , by the way — they express a young girl’s matt and pale complexion , and its sharp contrast with her black hair wonderfully well with white paper and 4 strokes of the pen . Not to mention their black thorn-bushes , studded with a thousand white flowers .
I’ve finally seen the Mediterranean , which you’ll probably cross before me . Spent a week in Saintes-Maries , and to get there crossed the Camargue in a diligence , with vineyards , heaths , fields as flat as Holland . There , at Saintes-Maries , there were girls who made one think of Cimabue and Giotto slim , straight , a little sad and mystical . On the completely flat , sandy beach , little green , red , blue boats , so pretty in shape and colour that one thought of flowers ; one man boards them , these boats hardly go on the high sea — they dash off when there’s no wind and come back to land if there’s a bit too much . It appears that Gauguin is still ill . I’m quite curious to know what you’ve done lately ; I’m still doing landscapes , croquis enclosed . I’d very much like to see Africa too , but I hardly make any firm plans for the future , it will depend on circumstances . What I’d like to know is the effect of a more intense blue in the sky . Fromentin and Gérôme see the earth in the south as colourless , and a whole lot of people saw it that way . My God , yes , if you take dry sand in your hand and if you look at it closely . Water , too , air , too , considered this way , are colourless . No blue without yellow and without orange , and if you do blue , then do yellow and orange as well , surely . Ah well , you’ll tell me that I write you nothing but banalities . Handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
