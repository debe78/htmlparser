Letter|My dear Theo ,
I painted another head today — of a model whom I couldn’t pay , though — but being able to get it , I took it anyway .
I’ve also now had a definite promise that I’ll make a portrait of someone , and then two studies for me in return .
I have to tell you , though , that I’m really hard pressed now — out of the near enough five francs that I still had — I had to buy two canvases for those two portraits , and my laundry has just come back . So that at the moment I have a few centimes left .
So what I’m urgently asking you is: for God’s sake don’t put off writing , and send me a lot or a little , such as you have — but know that I’m starving , literally .
If I succeed in getting 50 or so heads together , there’s a chance of getting work , that is to see about being employed by the photographers , which I wouldn’t want in the long run , but would do if needs must . The photographers seem to have plenty to do here . One also sees painted portraits in their shops , which they apparently work up on a background obtained by photography , which obviously has a weak , feeble effect to anyone who knows what painting is . It occurs to me now that one could get very much better colours if one worked with studies painted directly from life from the photographs that people want to see painted . And after all , at any rate this is one of the chances of earning something that one might have .
 
But whatever I want to begin and where — I have to be able to show things , that goes without saying .
Since I need all my high spirits , all my energy — putting it bluntly , I dread feeling physically weak .
I’ve been to see someone else with my view of Het Steen , who thought the tone and colour good , who was in a state of confusion drawing up his inventory and is in small premises , though , but where I could go back after the New Year . It’s a good thing for when there are foreigners who want to have a souvenir of Antwerp , and for this reason I’ll make a few more in the same genre of townscapes . Yesterday , for example , I drew a few studies for a thing in which one sees the cathedral . And similarly I also have a small one of the Park . However , I’d rather paint people’s eyes than cathedrals , for there’s something in the eyes that isn’t in the cathedral — although it’s solemn and although it’s impressive — to my mind the soul of a person , even if it’s a poor tramp or a girl from the streets , is more interesting . I consequently believe that nothing helps one progress so directly as working with a model . Of course it’s a great problem to have to pay the models we’re at a stage where it comes down to energy and
  the paintings will have to be energetic in order to find buyers .
I’m convinced that something can be done here . There seem to be a lot of beautiful women in this city , and it has to be the case that there’s money to be earned with either women’s portraits or imaginary women — heads and figures .
It’s a real pleasure for me to work with a rather better type of brush , and to have cobalt and carmine and a good brilliant yellow and vermilion .
The most expensive is still sometimes the cheapest . Cobalt especially — it can’t be compared with any other blue as regards the delicate tones that one can get with it .
And the quality of the colour may not be everything in a painting , but all the same that’s what gives it vitality .
As to whether or not I’d live here permanently — given that things don’t look exactly rosy in the art trade — and there seems to be something of a tendency for each painter to be his own dealer — which I imagine will increase still further in the long run — it might be wise to keep a studio here .
If you have any thoughts or wishes about it , either for or against , let me know as frankly as possible . But it strikes me right away that — if you should ever get to the point of working for yourself , independently of the Goupils , either sooner or later —
  Antwerp could perhaps be a place where , given the poor displays there are now , by exhibiting properly quite a lot could be done that the other houses don’t understand . Furthermore — It’s relatively easy to go back and forth to England from here .
Why — for the trade — are all paintings always in frames? As a commercial article there’s surely sometimes a lot to be said for something’s being light and easy to handle and to move .
The trade is old-fashioned and . . . thrice mouldered . There has to be renewal — and the old systems don’t exactly work well any more .
The prices — the public — everything needs renewing . And the future is working cheaply for the bourgeoisie , perhaps . At any rate — the ordinary art lovers themselves seem to be getting more and more set , becoming hard . Anyway .
Starting with capital so often only leads to losing everything first , and thus one’s courage and zest for work , too . Whereas starting with virtually nothing at least makes someone more decisive and firmer of character . Anyway .
Regards — but see that you write to me by return , for I have a faint sensation in my body because I’ve exerted myself rather a lot on this and that , and I need my strength .
Regards .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
