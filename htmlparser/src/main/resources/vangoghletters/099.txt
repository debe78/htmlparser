Letter|Isleworth , 25 Nov . 1876
My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your last letter , which I received at the same time as one from Etten . So you’re back at the gallery . Do whatever your hand finds to do , with all your might , and your work and prayers cannot fail to be blessed . How I’d have liked to go along on that walk to Het Heike and to Sprundel in the first snow . But before I go further , I’ll copy out a couple of poems that you’ll no doubt like .
The journey of life
Two lovers by a mossgrown spring
They leaned soft cheeks together
Mingled the dark and sunny hair ,
And heard the wooing thrushes sing
o Budding time
o Loves best prime .
Two wedded from the portal steps
The bells made happy carolings
The air was soft as fanning wings
While petals on the pathway slept
O pure eyed bride
o tender pride .
Two faces o’er a cradle bent
Two hands above the head were locked
These pressed each other while they rocked
Those watched a life which love had sent
O solemn hour
o hidden power .
Two parents by the evening fire
The red light fell about their knees
On heads that rose by slow degrees
Like buds upon the lily spire
O patient life
O tender strife .
The two still sat together there
The red light shone about their knees
But all the heads by slow degrees
Had gone and left that lonely pair
O Voyage fast
O Banished past .
The red light shone upon the floor
And made the space between them wide
They drew their chairs up side by side
Their pale cheeks joined , and said ‘once more’
O , memories!
O past that is!
The three little chairs .
They sat alone by the bright woodfire
The grey-haired dame and the aged sire
Dreaming of days gone by ;
The tear drop fell on the wrinkled cheek
They both had thoughts that they could not speak ,
And each heart uttered a sigh .
For their sad and tearful eyes descried
Three little chairs placed side by side
Against the sitting room wall ;
Old fashioned enough as there they stood
Their seats of flag , and their frames of wood ,
With their backs so straight and tall .
Then the sire shook His silvery head ,
And with trembling voice he gently said ,
‘Mother , those empty chairs ,
They bring us such sad , sad thoughts tonight ,
We’ll put them for ever out of sight
In the small dark room upstairs’ .
But she answered: Father , no , not yet ;
For I look at them , and I forget
That the children went away ,
The boys come back , and our Mary , too ,
With her apron on of checkered blue
And sit here every day .
Johnny still whittles a ships tall masts ,
And Willie his leaden bullets casts
While Mary her patchwork sows ;
At evening time three childish prayers
Go up to God from those little chairs ,
So softly that no one knows .
Johnny comes back from the billowy deep ,
Willie wakes from the battle field sleep ,
To say good night to me:
Mary’s a wife and mother no more ,
But a tired child whose play-time is o’er ,
And comes to rest on my knee .
 
So let them stand there – though empty now ,
And every time when alone we bow
At the Fathers throne to pray ,
We’ll ask to meet the children above
In our Saviours home of rest and love ,
Where no child goeth away .
In his letter Pa wrote , among other things: ‘in the afternoon I had to go to Hoeven , Ma had ordered the cab but it couldn’t come , because they hadn’t yet been able to have the horses’ shoes frosted – I therefore decided to go on foot and good Uncle Jan didn’t want me to go alone , so he came along . It was a hard journey , but Uncle Jan rightly said: the devil is never so black that you can’t look him in the face . And indeed , we arrived there and returned safe and sound , even though there was a gale blowing , coupled with freezing rain , so that the roads were slippery as ice , and I cannot describe how wonderful it was to sit so cosily in a nice warm room in the evening , resting after work – that dear Theo was still with us then’ .
Shall we , too , go once again to some church in this way? As sorrowful yet alway rejoicing , with everlasting joy in our hearts because we are the poor in the kingdom of God , because we have found in Christ a friend in our lives that sticketh closer than a brother , who brought us to the end of the journey as to the door of the Father’s house . May God grant it – what God hath done is done aright .
Last Sunday evening I went to a village on the Thames , Petersham . In the morning I had been at the Sunday school at Turnham Green , and went after sunset from there to Richmond and then on to Petersham . It grew dark early and I wasn’t sure of the way , it was a surprisingly muddy road over a kind of embankment or rise on the hill covered with gnarled elm trees and shrubs . At last I saw below the rise a light in a small house , and scrambled and waded over to it , and there I was told the way . But , old boy ,
  there was a beautiful little wooden church with a kindly light at the end of that dark road , I read Acts V:14-16 . Acts XII:5-17 , Peter in prison , and Acts XX:7-37 , Paul preaching in Macedonia , and then I told the story of John and Theagenes yet again . There was a harmonium in the church , played by a young woman from a boarding school that was attending en masse .
In the morning it was so beautiful on the way to Turnham Green , the chestnut trees and clear blue sky and the morning sun were reflected in the water of the Thames , the grass was gloriously green and everywhere all around the sound of church bells . The day before I’d gone on a long journey to London , I left here at 4 in the morning , arrived at Hyde Park at half past six , the mist was lying on the grass and leaves were falling from the trees , in the distance one saw the shimmering lights of street-lamps that hadn’t yet been put out , and the towers of Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament , and the sun rose red in the morning mist – from there on to Whitechapel , that poor district of London , then to Chancery Lane and Westminster , then to Clapham to visit Mrs Loyer again , her birthday was the day before . She is indeed a widow in whose heart the psalms of David and the chapters of Isaiah are not dead but sleeping . Her name is written in the book of life . I also went to Mr Obach’s to see wife and again . Then from there to Lewisham , where I arrived at the Gladwells at half past three . It was exactly 3 months ago that I was there that Saturday their was buried , I stayed with them around 3 hours and thoughts of many kinds occurred to all of us , too many to express . There I also wrote to Harry in Paris . I hope you’ll see him sometime .
 
It may well be that you too will go to Paris sometime . That night I was back here at half past ten , I went part of the way with the underground railway . Fortunately I’d received some money for Mr Jones . Am working on Ps . 42:1 , My soul thirsteth for God , for the living God . At Petersham I told the congregation that they would be hearing poor English , but that when I spoke I thought of the man in the parable who said ‘have patience with me , and I will pay thee all’ , God help me .
At Mr Obach’s I saw the painting , or rather the sketch , by Boughton the pilgrim’s progress . If you can ever get Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s progress , it’s very worthwhile reading . For my part I love it with heart and soul .
It’s night-time now , I’m still doing a bit of work for the Gladwells at Lewisham , copying out one thing and another etc . ; one must strike while the iron is hot and soften the human heart when it is burning within us . Tomorrow off to London again for Mr Jones . Beneath that poem The journey of life and The three little chairs one should write: that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth . So be it . A handshake in thought , give my regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and to everyone at Rooses’ and Haanebeeks’ and Van Stockums’ and Mauves’ , adieu and believe me
Your most loving brother
Vincent
