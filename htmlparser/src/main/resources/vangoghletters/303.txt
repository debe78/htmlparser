Letter|My dear friend Rappard .
I now have The Graphics in my possession . I sat looking at them until deep into the night .
I don’t know whether you know volumes 70-75 , for example ; perhaps you have them yourself in the batch you bought .
But assuming you don’t have them , you’ll certainly be delighted by those first years if you have an opportunity to see them .
I sincerely hope you have them in your batch , and otherwise I’ll write to you at length sometime , since there’s so much that’s important in them , pending your seeing them . And one way or another you must also get them for your collection .
For example , they contain a series of drawings from coal-mines by Ridley — done in a way that brings to mind etchings by Whistler or Seymour Haden . There are similar drawings , mainly of America , by Boyd Houghton . Up to now I thought of Boyd H . as not ALL THAT interesting . Also sketches by him from the days of the Commune , pétroleuses , a barricade &amp ; c .
Herkomer is superb — today I saw several large prints for the first time , Old women’s home , old men’s home , cobbler , Skittle alley , Orphan men , Lodging house &amp ; c .
There are also Pinwell and Fred Walker in those first years .
 
Then C . Green , Buckman , Brewtnal , Small , H . Woods , Macbeth , Gregory , various sketches of poor neighbourhoods &amp ; c .
Frank Holl , the foundling , superb
  	I am the Resurrection and the life , „
Railway station
Sight seeing
There you have 3 prints that I hadn’t seen in 10 years .
I come back to Boyd Houghton again — a Shaker or Mormon church , unbelievably real .
A few fine prints by Fildes .
Then large DU MAURIERS , sunny , and clear in the shade .
Enough , you’ll understand that they contain riches .
I long so much to have some more information about your find . If you have London News from the period 70-75 , I’d dearly like to know what the main contents are . I’m sure to have duplicates as a result of my new purchase .
I don’t know how I’ll do it . This Graphic series is in excellent condition , neatly bound . It’s almost a pity to undo it . But being
  able to arrange the prints so that the work of each draughtsman is brought together is also important .
Listen , old chap , if you have the old Graphic volumes in your batch , then you know all about it . But if not , then you’ll get a strong impression if you see them at my place sooner or later .
For me , looking through them brought back all the memories of London 10 years ago , when I first saw them , and they made such an impression on me that I’ve gone on thinking of them ever since , for instance the Foundling by Holl and the old wives by Herkomer .
At the same time , though , I had a melancholy feeling when I saw such clear confirmation of the words of H . Herkomer that you sent to me some time ago , namely that the later Graphic issues , however fine sometimes , have in general declined a very , very long way .
But the first!
 
I’m missing part of volume 70 , but apart from that 70-80 complete . Altogether 21 volumes .
I’ll find that first volume as well , sometime .
But how are you? Do write soon , at length or in brief . And if you’re still weak sometimes , and would perhaps like to have a look at some of those early volumes at home , I could send them to you .
There’s something cheering and strengthening in those lively , vigorous , manly drawings as there is in old wine .
Adieu , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
