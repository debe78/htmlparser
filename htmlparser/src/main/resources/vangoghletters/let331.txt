Letter|My dear Theo ,
Many sincere thanks for your letter and the enclosure . I was pleased to learn about your in more detail from it , the more so since it seemed to me that these reports may be called highly favourable . Isn’t what they call a white tumour something that sometimes occurs of its own accord in anaemia when certain malignant elements are in the blood? I don’t know for sure , but I believe that in itself the abscess in question isn’t something unusual and , given the proper treatment , not in the least dangerous . And otherwise you write various good things .
What you write about influence on others is very nice . I believe in things like that — the influence exercised by a good person sometimes extends a long way . The comparison with leaven is well taken . Two good people — man and woman united — wanting and intending the same , steeped in the same earnestness , what couldn’t they achieve! I’ve thought about that often . For by uniting , the force for good is not only doubled but doubled many times — as if raised to a higher power , to put it in mathematical terms .
Well – then your description of the house and its surroundings — the cab-stand is very good . Stands out from other townscapes by you because of the more distinctive staffage — the cab-stand is excellent . Couldn’t you arrange for the figure with the red nose to pose for me sometime?
 
I’m pleased that you’ve spoken to friend Wisselingh — so he’s come back to Paris — still in Cottier’s firm? Would you give him my regards when you have an opportunity? If he ever comes to Holland , a visit from him — which he has actually promised me by the way — would give me great pleasure . I’d like you to encourage him not to forget this , I still have various things to ask him about London . Has he seen the lithographs? I’d like to make his acquaintance all over again , I always found much in him that was attractive , and he knows a great deal and has a true and original feeling in matters of art . In short , is someone with character .
The little scratch overleaf is after a drawing I began early this morning and toiled away at all day . It’s perhaps the best I’ve done so far , at least as regards light and shade . I’m sending you the scratch (although I can’t possibly work on this paper so that the same strengths come into it , it’s out of proportion — and the drawing has more foreground) because I believe you’ll see in it what I gain by the change in the light in the studio . This figure is posed against the light and something more than an outline is required in order to depict it , since light from a single source gives character to the form and brings the strengths into harmony and rapport with each other . And in the first place this approach entails the difficulties of depicting what one has before one’s eyes , but in addition something else that requires a lot of hard work , namely the question of how to position a figure and to have the light fall such that the character comes out at its best and most perfect . One must have analyzed what one sees inside or outside as regards the light in such a way that one can re-create it .
 
 
I’m very pleased that you write that you have the natural chalk . It didn’t come in the post today , however , although you write that you’ve sent it . Should you have forgotten it , let me remind you about it again , and if you’ve already sent it , no doubt it will come soon . I again have a stock of lithographic crayon , and wanted to combine the natural chalk with that , which I believe must be possible .
This week I was busy drawing Wheelbarrows ; one chap seen from behind has turned out fairly real , I think . Van der Weele came by , we held a viewing of woodcuts , very cosily on a wheelbarrow , for I’d just been working with a model . He’s also going to start collecting them , and is to take steps to get some from the estate of Stam the wood engraver that he collected . I hadn’t written before that little by little I have almost the whole Graphic complete , from the beginning in 1870 .
Not everything , of course , there’s too much lumber for that , but the beauties from it .
When one sees it , Herkomer’s work from it for example , arranged together instead of dispersed amid a mass of insignificant things , in the first place it becomes more enjoyable and easier to view , but then one also begins to see the peculiarities of the various masters better , and the great difference between the draughtsmen .
 
How much I would like to see something by Lhermitte .
I can’t tell you how happy I feel because of the improvements to the studio , and how preoccupied I am once more with all manner of figures that I must do .
Van der Weele saw the studies of heads from this winter among others — I’m certain they’ll be of use to me — as , indeed , will the other studies .
Do you know what pleased me? You remember that Van der W . also came by one time this winter — it’s months ago now — I was working on studies of Diggers at the time — one of which I tried to lithograph . He saw them but they didn’t seem to interest him , far from it .
Now he has evidently had diggers pose recently for the painting he’s working on , or observed them at work somewhere — anyway , he has taken a close look at diggers in nature .
When we came to those diggers while looking through my studies , the way he spoke about them was very different from what it was this winter — at least he didn’t say so readily ‘this or that is different’ . This time I myself said nothing at all about them . But more and more I begin to see both in myself and others how mistaken one can often be when one thinks this or that ‘isn’t so’ or ‘doesn’t look right’ ; above all , one often says it instinctively when it isn’t applicable , I myself no less than others . One imagines one knows for certain , but has to retract if one wants to be fair .
 
Your description of the cab-stand and the venerable urinal and the bills stuck on it is really very good — it’s a great pity you don’t draw it .
Speaking of bills , the place where they’re put up is sometimes a curious parody of the bill , or the other way round .
To mention just one of many — at the entrance to the Lombard or pawnshop I saw a bill with the following words in big letters
 	Prospectus
 	Eigen Haard .
NB . As you probably know , Eigen Haard is a magazine . I thought this one rather good ; if one kept an eye out for them one would find even better ones .
Gavarni once came up with one , namely this . The entrance of a house with the announcement ‘Children weaned here’ . Standing on the doorstep are a woman with a most unprepossessing appearance and a fellow with a short pipe in his mouth , evidently the people from the institution . A bill is posted on the wall . Lost a child — so and so .
Similarly , At the meeting-place of the brotherhood is the sign of an estaminet where several drunken fellows are squabbling .
Rappard wants to send a large painting to the Amsterdam exhibition . It shows 4 tile painters around a table . I’ve heard good things about it indirectly .
 
Although it isn’t part of my plan at present to do large paintings for exhibitions , I wouldn’t like to work less than Rappard , say .
I even find something encouraging in the fact that one person can work in this direction and another in that , and yet still feel a sympathy . Rivalry stemming from envy is completely different from trying to do one’s best to make the work as good as possible precisely out of respect for each other . Extremes meet — I don’t see the slightest value at all in envy , but I would despise a friendship that didn’t entail making an effort to keep up with one another .
What I’m beginning to long for very much at times is to work with several models at once . To do drawings that are slightly more complicated . But this desire isn’t pressing — after all , I have enough to do .
At Van der Weele’s I saw the studies for his big painting . Those studies were outstanding — conscientious — but anyone with some understanding of how studies from nature are made , and the difference between them and a painting or definitive composition , won’t expect to find the painting in the studies — obviously . One doesn’t see the greatness and unity of the painting in the studies — that’s not surprising . Because the studies are done for the figures , horses or people , it doesn’t matter , the setting is ignored , there’s not enough foreground , background , &amp ; c . They don’t look right , and they’re not standing in their place as in the painting . Does everyone understand that when looking at studies? Bear that in mind when you’re looking at mine — especially when sooner or later you see what I still have here . This week , for the fun of it , I set down one or two in a different proportion so that I could merge them into a whole . Through a simple indication of a few lines and washing in a few flat tones of sepia , what for once I’ll call the painting-like quality came into it naturally . I just mean to say — don’t think that I look differently from , say , Van der Weele as regards seeing space in nature . Adieu , write again soon , best wishes .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
In this scratch you see something of what I said at the end of this letter — here there’s now no foreground at all — at any rate in the actual study there’s a little more — but if I combine this study with , for instance , one of the diggers , say the one I lithographed — then belonging with this is a large , flat piece of land in front and , for example , a brushwood fence behind , and right at the top something of the sky would be visible , just to indicate where the light comes from . Then perhaps it would become a composition breadthways , and the figure would be in its setting and in its place . If I did all that in the study itself , the figure would be so small that it would be of no use to me as a serious study for the figure . Believe me , the appearance isn’t a tough job , if my studies are good I’m very calm about that point .
And Space , Sky , breadth — don’t think that I rationalize them away — but one shouldn’t begin with them , first the foundation — then the roof will follow in its own time .
