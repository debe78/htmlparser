Letter|My dear Theo ,
Yesterday I sent a number of painted studies by post , and today , Wednesday , a crate marked V1 , free domicile , containing the painting . Please send me word of receipt , and at the same time whether the postage was in order .
If not , I’d like to know for later consignments . If it was correct , it cost me not quite 2 guilders , which I believe works out cheaper than if one calculates the carriage in Paris , and we can try it again sometime , with fairly large dimensions too .
I don’t know what you’ll think of the painting , but be it for this , be it for later canvases , be particularly careful when it comes to ordering frames .
Because for the time being we can use the money better for making new ones . And only start framing them when we’ve got a few together .
At least , that would be the most agreeable to me . The expenses for the many studies that I’m making are really rather more than I can encompass in the circumstances .
  I’ve just had to pay 25 guilders rent , as well .
All the same , the painting seems to me to demand to be seen against a tone like gold or copper . Because then the marbling effect disappears and it appears that the lights are still deep . But one can easily achieve this effect by holding a piece of paper in , say , an ochre colour behind it .
It wasn’t completely dry when I packed it , but I thought it couldn’t really be damaged any more .
I would like to have done much more to it , though , but because of the sinking in and since it had already been lifted more than once , I could see that I had to stop . And start again on something else .
My move is now complete ; at home they’re rather different from what you suppose , and they say I’ve had ‘my way’ . Well — it’s all the same to me , and I’d rather not talk about it .
I must get to work , so adieu for today .
 
I’ve had another 2 stretching frames made , the same size as this canvas . I think that once we have , say , 3 or 4 paintings of a certain size , it would then be worthwhile getting a frame made in that sort of size . But for a single one it’s too risky , and it’s better to paint a lot .
Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
