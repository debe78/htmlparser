Letter|My dear Theo ,
Included herewith a quite , quite remarkable letter from Gauguin , which I’ll ask you to put aside as being of extraordinary importance . I’m speaking of his description of himself , which touches me in my heart of hearts . It reached me with a letter from Bernard , which Gauguin will probably have read and of which he perhaps approves , in which Bernard again says that he wishes to come here , and proposes to me , in the names of Laval , Moret , another new one and himself , an exchange with the four of them . He also says that Laval will come too , and that those two others have a wish to come . I couldn’t ask for more , but when it’s a matter of several painters living communally , I stipulate first and foremost that there would have to be a father superior to impose order , and that naturally that would be Gauguin . That’s why I’d wish Gauguin to be here some time before them (in any case , Bernard and Laval won’t come until February , as Bernard has to go before his recruitment medical board) . For my part , I wish for two things: I wish to earn back the money that I’ve already spent , to return it to you , and I wish Gauguin to have his peace and quiet to produce and to breathe as a truly free artist . If I earn back the money already spent and that you’ve been lending me for years , we’ll make the thing bigger and we’ll try to found a studio of renaissance , not of decline .
 
I’m fairly sure that we could count on Gauguin’s staying with us for good , and that there’ll be no loss on either side .
But by joining together in this way , we’ll each of us be more ourselves , and unity will bring strength .
By the way , it goes without saying that I shan’t do the exchange with G . ’s portrait , because I think it’ll be too beautiful — but I’ll ask him to let us have it for his first month or in repayment of his fare .
But you can clearly see that if I hadn’t written to them rather strongly , this portrait wouldn’t exist , and Bernard has done one too , so:
Let’s agree that I was angry , let’s agree that it was wrong , but it’s still the case that Gauguin has given birth to a painting , and Bernard as well .
Ah — my study of the vineyards — I sweated blood and tears over it — but I have it — another square no . 30 canvas — once again for the decoration of the house .
I have no canvas left at all .
Do you know that if we have Gauguin , there we’ll be , at the start of a very important affair , which will open up a new era for us .
When I left you at the Gare du Midi , very upset and almost ill and almost an alcoholic as a result of overdoing it —
I’ve always vaguely felt that last winter we put our very hearts into our discussions with so many interesting people and artists , but I didn’t dare to hope yet . After constant effort on your part and mine until now , it’s beginning to appear on the horizon: Hope .
It doesn’t make any difference whether you stay with the Goupils or not , you’ll stand solidly behind Gauguin and his crowd .
 
That way , you’ll be one of the first apostle-dealers , or the first .
For myself , I can see my painting ahead , and also a labour among artists . Because if you , now , will try to obtain money for us —
I myself will put everything that comes within my grasp towards production , and I’ll set an example of that myself .
Now all that , if we hold firm , will go to build something more durable than ourselves .
I have to reply to Gauguin and to Bernard this afternoon , and I’m going to tell them that whatever happens , we’ll begin by feeling firmly united and that I for one have confidence that this unity will be our strength against the inevitabilities of money and of health .
I’ll ask you to go and see Thomas all the same , because before Gauguin comes I’d like to buy some more things — the following .
table with chest of drawers	 	francs	 
sheets	 	-	 
drawing boards	 	-	 
stove	 	 
(	Frames and stretching frames	 	 )	 
(	Colours and canvases	 	)	 
Now that’s a lot , and none of it is absolutely indispensable . We can do without all of it . But the broader and more substantial character that I’d wish to give the thing would nevertheless demand it .
 
For example , the 4 additional sheets — I already have 4 — will make it possible for us to put Bernard up for nothing , seeing that we’ll put a palliasse or a mattress on the floor for me or for him , as we choose . The kitchen stove will heat the studio for us at the same time .
But , you’ll say — and these colours . . . . . . Ah , well , yes , I blame myself for it — but after all , I have the self-esteem to wish to make a certain impression on Gauguin with my work . I can’t help wishing to work on my own as much as possible before he comes . His arrival will change me in my way of painting , and I’ll gain by it , I dare believe — but all the same , I’m rather attached to my decoration , which is almost barbotine . And these recent days are superb .
There are 10 no . 30 canvases on the go now .
Gauguin’s fare , then . We’d have to add it on top . But if Thomas isn’t willing to act a little generously , Gauguin’s fare first and foremost , to the detriment of your pocket and of mine . FIRST AND FOREMOST .
All this expenditure that I’ve mentioned would all be for the purpose of making a good impression on him at the time of his arrival . I’d like him to have a sense of the thing right away , and I’d like us to have — you for the money and I for the setting up and arrangement — made the studio complete , and such that it’s a setting worthy of Gauguin , the artist , who’s going to be its head .
 
It would be a good move , like the one back then , when Corot , seeing Daumier at bay , gave him enough to live on , in such a way that the other was well pleased with everything .
But it can already work now , just as it is . The fare’s the essential thing , and my colours can wait , although I dare believe that one day I’ll earn more with them than they’re costing us .
I wouldn’t disapprove in the very least if Gauguin gave you a monopoly in his work , and if right away , right away we raised his prices — nothing under 500 . He should have confidence in you — well , he’ll have it . I feel that we’re working on a big , good enterprise that has nothing in common with the old way of doing business . As for colours , it’s almost certain that with Gauguin we’ll grind it ourselves . I’ve painted the vineyards entirely with Tanguy’s colours , and it works well , the coarser grain’s no problem at all .
If we continue to approach things from the right point of view , that’s to say of people and not of material things , it still seems not entirely improbable to me that our material problems may smooth themselves out .
Because one matures in the storm .
I’m continuing to frame studies , because they’re part of the furnishings and give things character .
If Gauguin gives the monopoly , and does so both officially , as you’re with the Goupils , and in private , as your friend and someone in your debt , then in return Gauguin will be able to feel himself head of the studio , and control the money
  as he’ll see fit , and if it can be done , help Bernard , Laval , others , in exchange for studies or paintings , while I’ll be under the same conditions , I’ll give studies in return for 100 francs and my share of canvas and colours .
But the more Gauguin feels that by joining us he’ll have the position of head of a studio , the sooner he’ll recover and the keener he’ll be to work . Now the more finished the studio is , and firmly established for the use of many passing visitors , the more ideas will come to him , and the ambition to make it truly alive . Since they’re talking about nothing else at Pont-Aven at the moment , they’ll talk about it in Paris , too ; and once again , the better it is , the more firmly established it is , so much the better , before long , will be the general impression created , and the chance that it will work .
Ah , well , it’ll turn out as it’ll turn out . I only say that from now , in order to avoid future arguments , if it works in such a way that Laval , Bernard do in fact come , it won’t be me but it will be Gauguin who’ll be the head of the studio . As far as internal arrangements are concerned , I believe that we’ll be in agreement in any case .
I hope that on Friday I’ll have your next letter . Bernard’s letter is once again full of the conviction that Gauguin is a truly great master , and an absolutely superior man in terms of character and intelligence .
Good handshake , and more soon .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
The vines that I’ve just painted — are green , purple , yellow — with bunches of violet grapes , with black and orange shoots . On the horizon , some blue-grey willows , and the press-house far , far away , with a red roof , and silhouette of town in the distance , lilac .
In the vineyard , little figures of ladies with red sunshades and other little figures of grape-pickers with their cart .
A blue sky above and a foreground of grey sand . It makes a pendant for the garden with the round bush and the oleanders .
I believe that you’d prefer these 10 canvases to the whole of the last consignment , and I dare hope to do as many again during the autumn .
  It’s becoming even richer day by day . And when at leaf-fall — I don’t know if that happens here in the first days of November , as at home — when all the foliage of the trees is yellow , it will be something marvellous , against the blue . Ziem has shown us these glories many times already . Then a short winter — and afterwards we’ll be back to the orchards in blossom again .
