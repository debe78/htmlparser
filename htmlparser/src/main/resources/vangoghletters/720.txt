Letter|My dear ,
One thing that has given me great pleasure is that I’ve finally received a reply from Mrs Mauve .
As I want to write to her one of these days I’d ask you to send me her current address immediately and without error . Her letter was dated from The Hague , but she doesn’t say if she’ll stay there ; personally I thought she was still living in Laren .
She says she’s also had a nice letter from you .
I received your letter dated from Middelharnis , and I thank you very much for it . It’s good that you’ve at last begun to read Au bonheur des dames &amp ; c .
There are so many things in it , as there are in Guy de Maupassant as well .
I’ve already replied to you that I didn’t like Mother’s portrait enormously . I’ve now just painted a reminiscence of the garden at Etten , to put in my bedroom , and here’s a croquis of it . It’s quite a big canvas .
[sketch A]
 
Now here are the colours . The younger of the two women walking is wearing a Scottish shawl with green and orange checks and carrying a red parasol . The old one has a blue-violet shawl , almost black . But a bunch of dahlias , some lemon yellow , others variegated pink and white , explode against this sombre figure .
Behind them a few emerald-green cedar or cypress bushes . Behind these cypresses one catches a glimpse of a bed of pale green and red cabbages , surrounded by a border of little white flowers . The sandy path is a raw orange , the foliage of two beds of scarlet geraniums is very green . Finally , in the middle ground is a maidservant dressed in blue who’s arranging plants with a profusion of white , pink , yellow and vermilion-red flowers .
There you are , I know it isn’t perhaps much of a resemblance , but for me it conveys the poetic character and the style of the garden as I feel them .
 
In the same way , let’s suppose that these two women walking are you and our . Let’s even suppose then that there may be not the slightest , absolutely not the slightest vulgar and fatuous resemblance , the deliberate choice of colour , the dark violet violently blotched with the lemon yellow of the dahlias , suggests Mother’s personality to me .
The figure in the Scottish plaid with the orange and green checks standing out against the dark green of the cypress , this contrast even more exaggerated by the red parasol , gives me an idea of you , vaguely a figure like those in Dickens’s novels .
I don’t know if you’ll understand that one can speak poetry just by arranging colours well , just as one can say comforting things in music . In the same way the bizarre lines , sought out and multiplied , and snaking all over the painting , aren’t intended to render the garden in its vulgar resemblance but draw it for us as if seen in a dream , in character and yet at the same time stranger than the reality .
I’ve now also painted a woman reading a novel .
[sketch B]
Abundant very black hair , a green bodice , sleeves the colour of wine lees , the skirt black , the background completely yellow , library shelves with books .
She’s holding a yellow book in her hand .
 
That’s all for today . But I remember that I haven’t yet told you that my friend Paul Gauguin , an Impressionist painter , now lives with me and that we’re very happy together , he encourages me a lot often to work purely from the imagination .
Give Mother my warm regards , and write without fail and by return with Mrs Mauve’s address . I kiss you and Mother in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
