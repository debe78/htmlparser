Paris , 14 Oct . 1875 .
My dear Theo ,
Yet again a few lines to cheer myself up as well as you . I advised you to get rid of your books , and I still advise you to do so , certainly , just do it ; it will give you peace . But while you’re doing it , take care not to become narrow-minded and to shy away from reading what is well written ; on the contrary , that is a comfort in our lives .
‘Whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be
  any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things . ’
Just seek light and freedom and don’t delve too deeply into the mire of the world .
How much I’d like to have you here , and show you the Luxembourg and the Louvre &amp ; c . , though I have the idea that in time you’ll be coming here too .
I’ve had rather a good letter from Anna , I’m sending it to you to read , but send it back . Pa once wrote to me ‘don’t forget the story of Icarus , who wanted to fly to the sun and , having arrived at a certain height , lost his wings and fell into the sea’ . You’ll often feel that neither I nor Anna are what we hope to become , and that we’re still a long way from Pa and others , that we’re lacking in solidity and simplicity and sincerity ; one can’t become simple and true all at once . But let’s persevere nonetheless , but above all be patient , those who believe shall not make haste ; yet there is a difference between
  our desire to become Christians and that of Icarus to fly to the sun .
I believe it can do no harm to have a relatively strong body , so take care to eat enough , and if occasionally you’re terribly hungry , or rather have a terrible urge to eat , be sure to eat well . I assure you that I also do it often enough and above all , have done . Especially bread , I believe , old boy , don’t hesitate , ‘Bread is the staff of life’ as the English say (although they also have a taste for meat , and even much too much of it in general) . And now , write to me again soon and tell me about everyday things too .
Remain steadfast , and give my regards to anyone who asks after me . Let’s hope we see each other in 10 weeks or so . I shake your hand heartily in thought , and am ever ,
Your loving brother
Vincent
