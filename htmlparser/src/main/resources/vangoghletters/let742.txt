My dear Van Gogh!
I received your kind letter in Holland and , now that my journey is over , I thank you very much for your friendship and for having thought of me .
The stay in your brother’s place has done me good , and I would be very happy if I’ve been able to contribute to lessening that emptiness around him that one so easily experiences in Paris .
In your country I made two copies after Rembrandt ‘the Suzanne’ in The Hague and   later ‘the Jewish wedding’ in Amsterdam . It’s the first time I’ve made copies , and I won’t do so again . It doesn’t say anything to me , if it wasn’t to have a memory of these magnificent masterpieces .
There are some talented painters among your compatriots , and the works of Mauve , Israëls and Breitner interested me very much , only it seems to me that they don’t make sufficient effort to see with their own eyes .
As for the Scandinavian painters , I found them the same as before my departure . Among the young ones there are many who want to produce something original and
  who are close to the Impressionists , but they’ve elected a reactionary and stupid jury which brings all progress to a halt .
I think that an Impressionist exhibition would do some good in Copenhagen by ridding us of certain conventions . We’ve already seen Claude Monet and Besnard – may others come!
At the moment the consignment for the Paris exhibition is being prepared – it’s said to be very good .
I would be happy to know if you are still staying in Arles , if everything is going well down there etc . , but you’ve probably had enough of it , and this letter will find you in Paris .
 
As for me , I must stay here this summer at least . If it’s possible next winter I’ll go to Paris , and I hope to see you again then .
How is your brother’s health? Please say hello to him from me . I hope to send him something soon . Adieu – good health and good luck . I shake your hand .
Chr . Mourier-Petersen .
