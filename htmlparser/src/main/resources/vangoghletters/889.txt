Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks much for your letter of the day before yesterday , and for the 50-franc note it contained . I waited for the consignment of colours and canvas from Tasset , which has just arrived , and for which I also thank you very much , to answer the question regarding the difference between Tanguy and Tasset colours . Well , it’s absolutely the same thing , in the Tasset tubes there are some from time to time , especially for the white , that aren’t filled properly . However , when Tanguy for his part also fills them badly too , — certainly without doing so deliberately – the tubes of cobalt , for example like the one I have in my hands – so I’m talking only based on the same fact that exists on both sides – I just don’t see why one would have any very serious things to reproach the other with .
Is there a difference in the invoices? That’s what would interest me more . And then in the colours there is adulteration as in wines . How can one judge correctly when , like myself , one knows nothing of chemistry . I’d nevertheless consider it very good that , should ère Tanguy be going to extraordinary lengths for us by putting his time and his effort into packing up and dispatching the canvases that are in his attic , then you should get paint from him , even if it’s a little worse than the other . It would only be fair .
 
But what he says about a difference in the tubes , I repeat , it’s pure imagination on his part . And the reason why we went to Tasset’s is that the latter’s colours are in general less insipid . Now this difference isn’t important , and if Tanguy has the good will to pack up the canvases stored at his place – fair that he has the order for the colours .
It was with pleasure that I made the acquaintance of the Dutchman , who came yesterday . He looks much too nice to be doing painting in the current conditions . If he nevertheless persists in wanting to do it I told him that he would do well to go to Brittany with Gauguin and De Haan , because he’ll live there on 3 francs a day instead of 5 francs , and will have good company . That I myself also hope very much to join them , since Gauguin is going there . I was really pleased to learn that they’re going to renew their attempt there . Certainly you’re right that it’s better for Gauguin than staying in Paris . Very pleased , too , that he likes the head of that Arlésienne . I really hope to do a few etchings of subjects from the south , let’s say 6 , since
  I can print them free of charge at Mr Gachet’s ; he’s very willing to run them off for nothing if I do them . It’s certainly a thing that must be done , and we’ll act in such a way that in some way it forms a sequel to the Lauzet-Monticelli publication , if you approve . And Gauguin will probably engrave a few of his canvases in combination with me . His painting which belongs to you , and especially for the rest of the Martinique things .
Which plates Mr Gachet will also print off for us . Of course we’ll leave him free to run off copies for himself . Mr Gachet will come one day to see my canvases in Paris , and then we’d choose the ones to be engraved . At the moment I have two studies on the go – one a bouquet of wild plants , thistles , ears of wheat , leaves of different types of greenery . One almost red , the other very green , the other yellowing .
The second study a white house amid greenery with a star in the night sky and an orange light at the window and dark greenery and a sombre pink note .
That’s all for the moment . I have an idea for doing a more important canvas of Daubigny’s house and garden , of which I already have a small study .
 
I was really pleased that Gauguin is going off with De Haan again . Naturally this Madagascar plan seems to me hardly possible to carry out , I would much prefer to see him leave for Tonkin . If , however , he went to Madagascar I’d be able to follow him there . For one should go there in twos or threes . But we aren’t there yet . Certainly the future is very much in the tropics for painting , either in Java or in Martinique , Brazil or Australia , and not here , but you feel that it hasn’t been proved to me that you , Gauguin or I are those people of that future . But certainly once again , there and not here , one day , probably soon , one will see Impressionists working who will hold their own with Millet , Pissarro . Believing in that is natural , but going there without the means of existence or a relationship with Paris , a mad impulse when for years on end one has rusted away while vegetating here . Well . Thanks again , and good handshake to you and your , and good health to the one , whom I’m really longing to see again .
Yours truly ,
Vincent .
