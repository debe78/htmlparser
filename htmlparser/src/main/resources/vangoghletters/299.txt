Letter|Dear brother ,
I’m sending you herewith a few more studies . And here’s an idea that I’ve been thinking about in the past few days . If you don’t find it tedious to see such sketches , I think it would be a good idea if I sent you 60 sketches , say , in a small portfolio sometime . Then you could look through them at your ease in your room . And the advantage would be that when you come , sooner or later , you would already have seen some things that I did last year . Otherwise we’d have to go through these studies very hastily if you only came for a short time .
 
But if you , too , think it would be a good idea to look through them in advance , so that I should send them in the next few days , then I take it I can count on your bringing them back this summer , say , can’t I? , because I’ll have to work from them later .
My next work depends in part on the studies staying together . Anyway — it may amuse you — because some of the orphan men , for example , are perhaps rather typical . Anyway , let me know about this .
 
Because I had to pay for some things at New Year I’ve now actually run out of money already , at least I have very little left . Try , if you can , to send before rather than after the tenth and I’ll be obliged to you . Adieu , old chap , I hope that the sketches will be more or less to your taste .
With a handshake .
Ever yours
Vincent
The drawings I’d like to send you are ditto figures like the lithographs , all sorts — men , women , children .
