Letter|My dear Theo ,
Many thanks for your letter , the 50-franc note and the Tasset consignment , colours and canvases , that has just arrived . He’d enclosed his invoice , which comes to 50 . 85 francs , which enabled me to check his prices and compare them with Edouard’s . He’s considerably cheaper than Edouard , which , combined with the 20% discount , means we can have no complaints about him . Now , for his canvas at 4 . 50 , I’ll probably be able to find out the price by the piece at first hand .
Now your letter brings me a big piece of news — that Gauguin accepts the proposal . Indeed , the best thing would be for him to dash straight over here instead of sorting out the mess he’s in there ; perhaps he’ll get into another one if he comes to Paris first . Perhaps , too , with the paintings he’ll bring he’ll make a deal , which would be very fortunate . My reply enclosed . I really want to say just this , that I feel enthusiastic not only about painting in the south — but just the same in the north too , feeling healthier than 6 months ago . So if it’s safer to go to Brittany where one can board for so little — from the point of view of outgoings I’m definitely prepared to go back to the north . But it must be good for him too , to come to the south .
Especially since in 4 months it’ll already be winter in the north . And this seems so certain to me , that two people having exactly the same work must , if circumstances prevent their spending more , be able to live at home on bread , wine and , well , everything else one might wish to add to that . The difficulty is to eat at home alone . Restaurants here are expensive because everyone eats at home .
 
Certainly neither Ricard nor Leonardo da Vinci are less beautiful because there are few of them — on the other hand , Monticelli , Daumier , Corot , Daubigny and Millet aren’t ugly because in many cases they were done at great speed and there are relatively many of them . As for landscapes , I’m beginning to find that some , done more quickly than ever , are among the best things I do .
It’s like that with the one of which I sent you the drawing , the harvest and the haystacks too — it’s true I have to retouch everything to adjust the workmanship a little , to harmonize the brushstrokes , but all the essential work was done in a single long session , and I’ll spare it as much as possible when I go back to it .
But when I come back from a session like that I can assure you my brain is so tired that if that sort of work is repeated often — the way it’s been during this harvest — I become totally distracted and incapable of a whole lot of ordinary things . At these moments the prospect of not being alone isn’t unpleasant . And I think very , very often of that excellent painter Monticelli , who people said was such a drinker and insane , when I see myself coming back from the mental labour of balancing the six essential colours , red — blue — yellow — orange — lilac — green .
Work and dry calculation , in which one’s mind is extremely stretched , like an actor on the stage in a difficult role — where you have to think
  of a thousand things at the same time in a single half hour .
Afterwards — the only thing that comforts and distracts — in my case — as in others , is to stun oneself by taking a stiff drink or smoking very heavily .
Which is no doubt not very virtuous , but it’s in order to go back to Monticelli .
I’d really like to see a drinker in front of a canvas or on the boards . Of course , it’s all too crude a lie , this whole malicious , Jesuitical tale of the Roquette woman about Monticelli .
Monticelli the logical colourist , able to carry out the most ramified and subdivided calculations on the ranges of tones that he balanced , certainly overtaxed his brain doing that work , as did Delacroix and Richard Wagner .
But if he did perhaps drink , it was only because — Jongkind too — being physically stronger than Delacroix and suffering more physically (Delacroix was richer) , it was , then — I , for one , would be well inclined to believe — because if they hadn’t done it — their rebellious nerves would have played other tricks on them . And Jules and Edmond de Goncourt say this , word for word — ‘we took very strong tobacco to stupefy ourselves’ in the furnace of creation .
 
Don’t believe , then , that I would artificially maintain a feverish state — but you should know that I’m in the middle of a complicated calculation that results in canvases done quickly one after another but calculated long beforehand . And look , when people say they’re done too quickly you’ll be able to reply that they looked at them too quickly . And besides , I’m now going over all the canvases a little more before sending them to you .
But during the harvest my work has been no easier than that of the farmers themselves who do this harvesting . Far from my complaining about it , it’s precisely at these moments in artistic life , even if it’s not the real one , that I feel almost as happy as I could be in the ideal , the real life .
If all goes well and Gauguin thinks it’s a good idea to join us , we could make the thing more serious by suggesting to him that he puts all his paintings in common , with mine , to share profits or losses . But that won’t happen or will happen of its own accord , depending on whether he found my painting good or bad , and also on whether or not we did things in collaboration . Have to write to Russell now , and I’ll hasten my exchange with him . We’ll have to work hard to try to sell something from my side to help with the expenses , but let’s take heart , despite our difficulties in working to safeguard the artists’ life , we’ll have fire in our bellies . Handshake , I’ll write to you again soon . I’m going to the Camargue for 2 or 3 days , to do some drawings there .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Good that you’re bringing our over .
Be patient a little longer with Mourier , perhaps he’s going through a crisis .
I’ll write to Mourier one of these days ; you’ll read the letter , you’ll see the way I used to talk to him . I can see the drawing from here!!! The head in the style of Delaroche .
