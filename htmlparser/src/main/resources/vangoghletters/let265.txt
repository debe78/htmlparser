Letter|My dear Theo ,
When you were here we talked about that drawing that I was to send you — further to which I’ve already sent you that small bench . I’m enclosing a few sketches to show you that I do indeed plan to carry on working in that genre .
I’m working on a watercolour of the one with the herds of orphans with their spiritual shepherds — with which I’ll probably not succeed to the point of making it saleable .
But to show you that figures with some character in them don’t get there of their own accord , and that I nonetheless take great pleasure in overcoming that , I’m also sending you scratches of figure studies which I did recently , and which are of course more elaborate than these little sketches .
Supposing I had remained on good terms with Mauve , I believe that if I had done a watercolour like the small bench or the present one with the orphans , he would have given me tips that would have made it saleable and changed its final appearance . With many people’s watercolours or paintings it’s even the case that some painter or other does some work on them , sometimes transforming them completely . I miss that now , but although I certainly don’t disapprove of more skilled painters either giving tips or even doing some work (mainly because it’s so vital for the younger ones to earn a little in order to keep going) , I don’t think it’s entirely a misfortune to wrestle alone . What one learns from oneself one learns less quickly , but it imprints itself more deeply .
I went to see the drawings in the Gothic Room . I thought the Rochussen superb . It was something from the Napoleonic period: French officers in a room in an old village hall who appear to be demanding papers or information from the mayor and the councillors . It was so real , that little old mayor and then those generals , just exactly as Erckmann-Chatrian describes it in Madame Thérèse . It gave me an extraordinary amount of pleasure . There were also very beautiful things by Allebé too , drawings from Artis , and also a landscape with pine trees on the rocks on the coast through which a fisherman’s house is seen below . There were beautiful town and beach views with small figures by Hoeterickx . However beautiful I find his present drawings , it seems to me a pity that he hasn’t stuck to his first manner , when he did types from the common folk (such as a painting At the pawnbroker’s) .
 
It’s more or less the same with drawing as with writing . When one learns to write as a child , one has the feeling that one will never discover how to do it , and it seems to be a miracle when one sees the schoolmaster write so quickly . Nevertheless , in time one grasps it . And I really believe that one must learn to draw in such a way that it’s as easy as writing something down , and that one must master proportion and learn to see in such a way that one can reproduce at will whatever one sees on a larger or smaller scale .
We’re having very beautiful bad weather at present — rain , wind , thunderstorms — but with splendid effects , that’s why I find it beautiful , but it does feel raw , by the way .
The time that one can sit outside is already getting decidedly shorter , and it’s important to make the most of it before winter comes .
Towards winter I empty the studio , namely take the studies off the walls and obstacles out of the way , so that I have a good space for working with models .
I feel that I need a host of figure studies , including Scheveningen ones .
When the opportunity arises I’d like to have the studies back that you don’t want to keep from among those you have , that is when there’s an opportunity to send them . If there’s something you would like to keep , or if there’s something you would like among what I have here , you only have to say so , for I regard it all as belonging to you . But if I ask for it back it’s because what one does directly from the model is often needed for watercolours , for example . But there’s no hurry , only don’t throw them away even if they’re not very beautiful , because everything is of use .
I don’t think I’m deceiving myself if I believe that being and remaining productive has to do with the studies one has and continues to make . The greater their variety , the harder one labours at them , the easier one works later when it comes to actual paintings or drawings . In short , I think of the studies as seed , and the more one sows the more one may hope to reap .
In the last few days I’ve been reading Les deux frères by Erckmann-Chatrian , which is quite beautiful . It was certainly an interesting time when there were so many artists in Alsace: Brion , Marchal , Jundt , Vautier , Knaus , Schuler , Saal , Van Muyden , and many others surely — at the same time as a group of writers working in the same spirit like Chatrian and Auerbach . Personally , I prefer that to Tapiró or Capobianchi , or the host of other Italians who appear to be still multiplying .
Adieu , believe me , with a handshake ,
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
 
You’ll see from this little scratch that I’ve begun doing what I spoke about in my last letter , namely trying to make notes regularly , either drawn or painted , of the scenes of workmen or fishermen that strike me , and these are precisely the things that could serve for illustrated magazines , I believe , if I practise them . It goes without saying , though , that then the types must be raised to a much higher standard .
I have at least 10 different events surrounding the arrival of that pink .
Likewise the one I sent in an earlier letter , the weighing of the anchor .
