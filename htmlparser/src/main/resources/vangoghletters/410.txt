Letter|My dear Theo ,
I lay awake half the night , Theo , after I’d written to you yesterday evening .
I’m heartbroken about the fact that when I come back now , after an absence of two years , the reception at home was as friendly and kind as could be , yet at bottom nothing , nothing , nothing has changed in what I have to call blindness and stupidity to the point of desperation when it comes to understanding the situation . Which was that we were going along in the very best of ways until the moment when Pa banned me from the house — not just in a passion but also ‘because he was tired of it’ . It should have been understood then that this was something so important to my succeeding or not succeeding that it was made ten times more difficult for me because of it — almost intolerable .
If I hadn’t felt the same then as I feel again now , that despite all the good intentions , despite all the friendliness of the reception , despite whatever you will , there’s a certain steely hardness and icy coldness , something in Pa that grates like dry sand , glass or tin — despite all his outward mildness — if I hadn’t already , I say , felt it then as I do now , I wouldn’t have taken it so badly then . Now I’m once again in almost unbearable indecision and inner conflict .
You understand that I wouldn’t write as I write — having undertaken the journey here of my own volition , having been the first to swallow my pride — if there wasn’t really something I’m running up against .
 
If I had now seen that there was any WILLINGNESS to do as the Rappards did with the best results and as we began here , also with good results , if I had now seen that Pa had also realized that he should not have barred the house to me , I would have been reassured about the future .
Nothing , nothing of all that . There wasn’t then , nor is there now any trace , any hint of a shadow of a doubt in Pa as to whether he did the right thing then .
Pa doesn’t know remorse as you and I and everyone who is human does . Pa believes in his own righteousness while you , I and other human beings are permeated with the feeling that we consist of mistakes and forlorn attempts .
I pity people like Pa , I can’t find it in my heart to be angry with them because I believe that they’re unhappier than I am myself . Why do I think they’re unhappier? Because they use even the good in them wrongly so that it works as evil — because the light that’s in them is black — spreads darkness , gloom around them . Their friendly reception desolates me — to me , the way they make the best of it , without recognizing the mistake , is even worse , if possible , than the mistake itself .
 
Instead of readily understanding and consequently promoting both my and indirectly their own well-being with a degree of fervour , I sense a procrastination and hesitancy in everything , which paralyzes my own passion and energy like a leaden atmosphere .
My intellect as a man tells me that I have to regard it as an unalterable fact of fate that Pa and I are irreconcilable down to the deepest depths . My compassion both for Pa and for myself tells me ‘irreconcilable? never’ — until eternity there’s a chance , one has to believe in the chance of an ultimate reconciliation . But the latter , oh why is it sadly probably ‘an illusion’?
Will you think that I’m making too much of things? Our life is an awful reality and we ourselves go on into eternity , what is — is — and our view , weighty or less weighty , takes nothing from and adds nothing to the essence of things .
That’s how I think about it when I’m lying awake at night , for instance , or that’s how I think about it in the storm in the sad twilight in the evening on the heath .
Perhaps I sometimes appear as insensitive as a wild pig during the day in everyday life , and I can readily understand that people find me coarse . When I was younger I used to think much more than now that the problem lay in coincidences or little things or misunderstandings that were groundless . But as I get older I draw back from that more and more , and I see deeper grounds . Life’s ‘an odd thing’ , brother .
 
You can see how up and down my letters are , first I think it’s possible , then again it’s impossible . One thing is clear to me , that it doesn’t happen readily , as I said , that there’s no ‘willingness’ . I’ve decided to go to Rappard and tell him that I would like it too if I could be at home , but that against all the advantages that this would have there’s a je ne sais quoi with Pa that I’m afraid I’m beginning to think is incurable , and that makes me apathetic and powerless .
Yesterday evening it’s decided that I’ll be here for a while , the next morning , despite everything , we’re back to — let’s think about it again . Go ahead , sleep on it , think about it!!! As if they hadn’t had 2 YEARS to think about it , ought to have thought about it as a matter of course , as the natural thing .
Two years , every day a day of worry for me , for them — normal life — as if nothing had happened or nothing would happen . The burden didn’t weigh on them . You say , they don’t express it but they feel it . i don’t believe that . I’ve sometimes thought it myself , but it’s not right .
People act AS they feel . Our actions , our swift readiness or our hesitation , that’s how we can be recognized — not by what we say with our lips — friendly or unfriendly . Good intentions , opinions , in fact that’s less than nothing .
You may think of me what you will , Theo , but I tell you it’s not my imagination , I tell you , Pa is not willing .
I see now what I saw then , I spoke out four-square AGAINST Pa then , I speak now in any event , whatever may come of it , AGAINST PA again , as being UNwilling , as making it IMPOSSIBLE . It’s damned sad , brother , the Rappards acted intelligently , but here!!!!!! And everything you did and do about it , 3/4 of it is rendered fruitless by them . It’s wretched , brother . With a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
I don’t care so much about a friendly or unfriendly reception , what grieves me is that they aren’t sorry for what they did then . They think that THEY DIDN’T DO ANYTHING then , and for me that’s going too far .
