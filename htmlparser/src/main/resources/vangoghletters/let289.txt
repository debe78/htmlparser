Letter|My dear Theo ,
In the last few days I had a letter from Rappard , with whom I’m in correspondence about the trials with lithography and who has himself done a little with it . I wrote to him in passing: I’ve run into another obstacle ; a letter with money that I had largely earmarked for them has been lost . He wrote in reply , don’t let that hold you back , and count on me if you can’t carry on or need something . I didn’t tell him so that he would say something like that , but because I wanted him to make some new trials himself . But it gave me pleasure because such signs of interest are rare . I wrote back to him: for the present I’m declining the offer , but we’ll return to the subject if it really does become a question of not being able to continue at all . And I told him how much I appreciated it . See , that’s one of the cases I wrote to you about in my last letter .
 
Of course there are costs involved in the drawing , the stone , the printing , the paper . These are relatively low . Prints like the last one I sent you , say , like a new one that I finished yesterday evening and is now ready , would I believe be suitable for a popular edition , for instance , which is so desperately , desperately needed here in Holland , more than elsewhere .
Now such an undertaking like making and printing a series of 30 with Working types , say — sower , digger , woodcutter , ploughman , washerwoman , plus on occasion a cradle or orphan man , in short , the whole vast field lies open , there’s an abundance of fine material — an enterprise like that — may one undertake it or may one not? It goes even deeper: is it a duty and just , or is it wrong? That is the question .
 
If I were a man of means , I wouldn’t hesitate to decide , I would say , Onward , and be quick about it .
But in this case it’s different . May one , must one , can one involve others whom one needs , without whom one can’t carry it out , and drag them into an affair of which it’s doubtful whether it will be profitable? I wouldn’t spare myself . You’ve shown through your help to me that you don’t spare yourself either . Yet others think it both wrong of you and foolish that you took an interest in me , and they believe even more strongly that what I do is absurd , and many who were full of enthusiasm at first end up thinking that too , and are only briefly brave and fiery , like a straw fire .
Really very unfairly in my view , for neither you nor I are acting foolishly in this . This matter , which not long ago was no more than a few words from you , namely ‘I’ve spoken to Buhot , who knows of a certain way of lithographing , of which more later , you ought to try something on paper that he’ll send you’ ,
  has in a short time taken on the proportions of a more important matter for me from this initially rather insignificant start .
I see that with persistence and perseverance it could become something which I believe could be absolutely not superfluous but decidedly good and useful .
It has always been said: in Holland we can’t make magazines for the people . I’ve never been entirely able to believe this . I see now: it CAN be done . The Society for General Welfare has given thousands to Elsevier in Rotterdam to support the publishing of De Zwaluw . Now has De Zwaluw turned out to be good? NO . While there were a few fine prints in it , it was too feeble , too insubstantial , not serious , not vigorous enough . An imitation of the English , not original enough . There are two systems , How not to do it and How to do it .
How not to do it was , I fear , Elsevier’s ulterior motive , OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT even if it had cost him his own money . How not to do it reasons as follows: I have so much and so much for it from the Welfare , I have so much and so much from sales — of that , I must put so and so much in my pocket first — I must do just as my colleagues do or they’ll call me an awkward customer or a man with a reputation &amp ; c . So it comes about that instead of saying what was written beneath a painting by Millais , ‘IT MIGHT BE DONE AND IF SO WE SHOULD DO IT’ , Elsevier and a thousand like him say , it can’t be done , or do it too feebly and without enough energy . I don’t know the management of De Zwaluw well enough to say exactly who’s to blame , but I know their magazine well enough to dare take upon myself to say , ‘you haven’t made of it what you could have made of it , it could and should have been better’ .
 
Now , moreover , I say all the same: be that as it may , in every age there have also been resolute , sincere , brave , honest Dutchmen ; even in times when things in general were feeble and enervated and wrong , here and there one found the fire still burning in hidden corners . How much more so in those periods in which the Dutch could be counted among the first and the best .
So when it comes down to daring and self-sacrifice and venturing on something that doesn’t have to be done for gain but because it’s useful and good: one must keep one’s trust in one’s fellow man and fellow countrymen in general .
Before I go any further , though , this — I personally don’t want to have any more to do with the business of prints for the people beyond the making of them , in the event that some such venture is started . It must be a matter of charity , not of bookshops .
And as it will be necessary to have some contact with the bookshops , if only as regards printing and so on , I mention it to you now , not to ask you , ‘do you think it will succeed?’ from the bookshop’s point of view , but just with the question How to do it?
  from the point of view that it would be out of love for the cause .
In my opinion the following would have to be laid down:
Given that it’s useful and needful for Dutch drawings to be made , printed and circulated , intended for workers’ dwellings , farmhouses , in a word , for every working man , several parties undertake to do their utmost , to exert their best efforts for this goal .
This association not to be dissolved before the venture is completed , and endeavouring to carry it out as practically and as well as possible .
The price of the prints is not to exceed 10 or at the most 15 cents .
Publication shall begin when a series of 30 has been made and printed , and the costs involved (for stones , printing wages , paper) have been paid . These thirty prints will appear simultaneously , although available separately , together forming a set in linen cover with a short text , not to go with the prints — which speak for themselves — but to explain pithily how and
  for what purpose they were made &amp ; c .
The raison d’être of the association is this . If the draughtsmen stand alone they’ll have to bear both the effort and the costs — the venture would founder before it was half way — so the burden must be shared so that each gets the part that he can bear and so that the venture can be accomplished .
The amount raised by sales will be used first to reimburse those who advanced money , second to give everyone who has supplied a drawing an amount to be determined later that is the same for each draughtsman .
When these payments have been made , what remains will be used for new publications to carry on the work .
Those who begin this venture regard it as a duty . Self-interest not being their aim , neither those who advance money nor draughtsmen nor those who participate in other ways may claim back what they have contributed in the event that the venture yields no profit , so that their contribution is lost ; nor may they claim back more than they have put in should the venture be successful beyond expectation .
In the latter case the surplus will be used to carry on the work , in the former case , however , the stones remain the property of the entrepreneurs ; in any event though , the first 700 impressions from each stone are intended not for the association but for the people . If the association founders , those prints will be distributed free of charge .
Immediately after the publication of the first series of 30 there must be a debate and decision on whether or not to continue , and at that point , but not before , whoever so wishes may withdraw from the association .
This is the idea that took shape in my mind — now I say to you: How to do it? Will you take part?
I haven’t spoken to others about this , the idea first having become clear to me while I was at work . But
  I’ve long been in touch with Rappard on the question of prints for the people , since both he and I attach importance to it , so that he himself , as I wrote to you , said to me of his own accord , I want to give you a helping hand .
Rappard doesn’t , however , view the matter in the way that I would like him to: the thing is , he doesn’t agree with me on questions of technique . As to his proposal about advancing me money , I’ve decided to agree to it .
I refuse it for myself personally , because I would only pursue it alone if the kind of association I’ve described to you couldn’t be established . At that point I would have to see what more I could do . For the present I share my thoughts about the matter with him , and ask him as I ask you , couldn’t we start something of that kind?
And for my part I would wish everyone in the association to be completely equal — with no regulations or president or this or that — just a memorandum laying down the venture which , after it had been finally drawn up and signed by the entrepreneurs , couldn’t be altered other than by a unanimous vote — also the names of those who committed themselves (but not to make them public ; the matter must be an artistic , a private venture) , together with what they are doing for the cause: A undertakes to make this or that , B gives this or that for it &amp ; c . , nothing more .
In the meantime it’s now 1 Nov . If you haven’t yet written , do so as soon as you possibly can . I have nothing left . Adieu , believe me , with a hearty handshake ,
Ever yours ,
Vincent
It should be an association for doing , not for debating — for acting decisively and without losing time , seeing the whole venture as ‘for charity’ , not ‘for bookshops’ .
 
Now something else . One must be prepared for what it entails .
30 stones , printing wages , paper .
What do they cost? I don’t know exactly , but I think 300 guilders would go a long way . The drawings are the contributions by the members of the association who cannot give any money .
I’m ready to take on all of them if no one else presents himself , but I would rather that better people than I took it on .
Sending the first 30 into the world seems to be desirable in any event , and I would be glad to carry on with it even if no enthusiasts came forward to make drawings for the time being , because showing that series to artists who could do it better than I might persuade them to take part . Many only want to start when they know for sure that it’s serious , and refuse to become involved as long as the first steps haven’t been taken .
