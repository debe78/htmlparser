Letter|Etten , 30 December 1877
My dear Theo ,
I wish you much happiness for the new year , may it be blessed for you in many ways . Those were good days , when you were here , though they didn’t last long . My holiday will be over soon , too , but I’ll stay at least a day longer because Pa’s so busy these days , and it would be good to discuss calmly how best to pursue further study .
Pa also has to preach at Princenhage on New Year’s Eve , because the Rev . Kuylman fell and hurt himself , dislocating his arm , and so is unable to take his turn on New Year’s Eve , and Pa has offered to do it for him . So Pa has to preach 9 times in 10 days .
If you haven’t yet sent that map &amp ; c . to Harry Gladwell , wait a while , I hear he’s no longer in Paris , wrote to father today . I may get a reply and will then add something to the roll .
You forgot to take the etching after Meissonier , I’ll send it to you one of these days with the lithograph after Jules Breton , The fields in winter , because I don’t want to accept it , it belongs in your collection .
It snowed last week and Cor had fun with the sledge and so did I , because I sledged on the road with him and a girl who was staying at Hackstrohs’ . Today Pa , Ma , Cor and I took a lovely walk , you should have been there .
Yesterday I saw the sewing school that Ma now holds in the consistory , it is indeed pleasant , one would like to have a painting of it , there are already quite a few children coming to it .
Another painting has occurred to me that is related to Brittany , namely Ribot , The prayer , a number of children kneeling in a corner of a church at dusk , there’s a large etching by him of the same thing , which you perhaps know . Jacque once made an etching of the same subject , but smaller .
Made a list today of everything I could remember about the French Revolution , so as to write it on the back of the map of France , and I hope gradually to expand on that work , recording , for instance , the most important things about the Middle Ages , or the time of the 80 Years’ War , and so on . One must hold on to what one has seen or what one knows , for it always comes in useful .
If you should make such lists from time to time , send them to me when you have the opportunity , then we can compare them , it’s good to do so — as far as knowledge is concerned , it’s important to hold on to what one has and to absorb it internally as much as one can ; especially when one is short of money , it’s good to fill the gaps with this and similar things .
 
Give my regards to all your housemates and wish them all the best from me . It’s not impossible that , on my way to Amsterdam , I could spend another night in The Hague and bring you the prints that you left here myself , but don’t count on it .
Adieu , again I wish you the best , and a hearty handshake in thought from
Your most loving brother
Vincent
