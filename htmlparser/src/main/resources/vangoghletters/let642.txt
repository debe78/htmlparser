Letter|My dear Theo ,
You’ll already have received my letter of this morning , in which I’d included 50-franc note for Bing , and it’s about this Bing business again that I wanted to write to you . The fact is , we don’t know enough about Japanese art .
Fortunately , we know more about the French Japanese , the Impressionists . That’s definitely the essence and the main thing .
So Japanese art , properly speaking , already with its place in collections , already impossible to find in Japan itself , is becoming of secondary interest .
But this doesn’t mean that if I had a single day in which I could see Paris again I wouldn’t call at Bing’s precisely to go and see the Hokusai and other drawings from the true period . What Bing himself , by the way , also said to me when I so much admired the run-of-the-mill Japanese prints , that later I’d see that there’s also something else . Loti’s book , Mme Chrysanthème , taught me this: the apartments are bare , without decorations or ornaments . And it was that that awakened my curiosity about the excessively synthetic drawings of another period . Which are probably to our Japanese prints what a sober Millet is to a Monticelli . You know well enough that I’m not averse to Monticellis , myself .
Nor coloured Japanese prints , either , even when people tell me ‘you should get out of that habit’ . But it seems to me , at the point we’ve reached , fairly indispensable to know the sober quality that is the equivalent of the colourless Millet .
 
That has little or nothing to do with the stock , properly speaking , which may as well stay as it is .
Because I don’t tire of those figures and landscapes . And he has so many of them!
If I wasn’t so caught up and absorbed in work , how I’d like to sell all that lot! There’s not much to be earned from it , and that’s why nobody takes it up . Nevertheless , after a few years it will all become quite rare , will be sold more dearly . It’s for that reason that we shouldn’t scorn the small advantage that we have at present , of going through thousands to make our choice .
Now , if you give a whole Sunday to this yourself , if you choose new stock for about a hundred francs , you can tell yourself beforehand that you won’t sell those , having chosen them yourself (unless you don’t like them) — you can pay for them as and when , replacing them all the time . In the end , when the whole batch has been paid for at your leisure , you still have as many more in stock . And the result is that what we like best in the lot stays with us . And it’s by doing it this way that , in what’s currently at your place , there are
  already many old sheets that are worth a good 1 franc each .
So I urge you , keep the advantages of the stock and don’t get rid of the fine sheets ; on the contrary , we profit by adding to them .
There are already some sheets that we have that are definitely worth 5 francs . My God , I wasn’t able to do as I wished , because I was just as excited about this lot of ten thousand Japanese prints to go through as Thoré about a sale of Dutch paintings , among which there were some interesting ones .
Really , at present my work has kept me busy ; I can’t do any more about it but I recommend Bing’s attic to you .
I learned there myself , and I got Anquetin and Bernard to learn with me .
Now , there’s still more to learn at Bing’s , and that’s why I urge you to keep our stock there , and access to the attics and cellars , and you see how far I am from seeing it as a speculation .
Supposing that it costs (myself , I don’t believe that we’d lose by it) , it doesn’t cost an enormous amount .
What’s Reid doing??? He’ll already have been there on his own account , perhaps , as will Russell . I didn’t conceal that there were some at Bing’s , only I said they were 5 sous , which Bing himself had told me — or rather , the manager . If you keep the stock , then tell him once again that we often send people directly to him
  but that he must therefore keep his Japanese prints at the stated price — of 5 sous — not less . I’m telling you only this — I’ve gone through the lot four or 5 times ; the sheets at our place are the result of replenishing the stock several times already .
Let’s continue in the same way . It has already been a great regret to me , who knows something about the lot , not to have paid at New Year myself , and chosen the new stock myself . Because you’re dazzled , there’s so much of it .
And in the other shops — it’s not the same thing at all , because people are afraid to go to Bing , thinking him expensive . Now , what I didn’t go through was the library , where there are hundreds , thousands of bound books .
Look , you’ll do well out of paying a visit to their manager — his name continues to escape me — make my profound excuses to him , please , but tell him that I was there three times at New Year to pay up , that afterwards came my journey to the south . And that will procure you a Claude Monet and other paintings , because if you take the trouble to dig out the Japanese prints , you certainly have the right to do exchanges with them , with the painters , for paintings .
But to break off our relations with Bing — oh no , never that .
Japanese art is something like the primitives , like the Greeks , like our old Dutchmen , Rembrandt , Potter , Hals , Vermeer , Ostade , Ruisdael . It doesn’t end .
 
If , though , I saw Bing’s manager , I’d say to him that when you put yourself out to find collectors for his Japanese prints — you waste your whole day there without thinking about it , and at the end of it all , whether you sell or you don’t sell , you lose money on it .
And you , if you don’t want to lose on it , I would urge you to make some exchanges with painters whom you know — as Besnard still owes you a study , to tell the truth .
Anyway , that’s perfectly natural , and the difficulty of working in Paris .
Today I sent Bernard 6 drawings after painted studies ; I promised him 6 more and asked for an exchange of croquis after his painted studies .
And there you have it , General Boulanger’s gone and done it again . It seems to me that both of them were right to fight , being unable to get along . That way at least there’s no stagnation , and both of them can only gain by it . Don’t you find he speaks very badly , Boulanger? He makes no impression in words at all . I don’t think him any the less serious for that , since he’ll be in the habit of using his voice for practical purposes , to explain things to his officers or to the managers of arsenals . But he makes no impression at all in public .
 
All the same , it’s a funny city , Paris , where you have to live by wearing yourself out , and as long as you’re not half dead you can’t do a damned thing , and still . I’ve just read Victor Hugo’s L’année terrible . There’s hope there , but — . . . . that hope’s in the stars . I find that true , and well said , and beautiful ; and what’s more , I readily believe it myself , too .
But let’s not forget that the earth’s a planet too , therefore a star or celestial globe . And what if all these other stars were the same!!!!!! It wouldn’t be very jolly , in fact you’d have to start all over again .
For art , now — for which you need time , it wouldn’t be bad to live more than one life . And it’s not without appeal to believe in the Greeks , the old Dutch and Japanese masters , continuing their glorious school on other globes . Anyway , that’s enough for today .
And look , there’s another Sunday got through , writing to you and writing to Bernard ; however , I must say it didn’t seem long to me . Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
If our could bring us some more wood engravings and things like Gavarni’s La masquerade humaine , 100 lithographs , the Charles Keene , of which there were a good 200 , it wouldn’t be bad . There’s also a very fine book , Anatomy for artists .
