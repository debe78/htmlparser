Paris , 13 Sept . 1875 .
My dear Theo ,
The photographs of the J . Breton and the Corot are for Helvoirt ; the rest are for you .
Send on the Helvoirt ones when you have the opportunity , but I’ll do my best to get another copy of the Rembrandt , so perhaps it would be better to delay sending them until I’ve sent you that one as well .
You’ll have received my letter of yesterday by now .
Warm regards ,
Vt .
