Letter|My dear Theo ,
Just a word to bid you good-day . I hope it will be convenient for you and your friend Bonger to look in on me this afternoon before you eat , so — let’s say between 3 and 5 .
I thought this would perhaps work out best — since then they’ll still have you at home the whole evening . I’m rather busy , since they’re harvesting the wheat in the fields and , as you know , this takes only a few days and is certainly almost the most beautiful of all .
But I’ll make sure to be in my studio today between 3 and 5 . In the evening I’ll drop in at Ma’s for a talk .
But for the rest , you mustn’t take it amiss of me if I keep on working .
With a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
