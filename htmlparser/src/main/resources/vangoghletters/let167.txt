Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m enclosing a word or two because they’re writing to you , for I thought you’d like to hear from me as well once in a while about what I’m actually doing .
If it isn’t raining , I go outdoors every day , usually on the heath .
I’m making my studies quite large , like a few you saw here during your visit .
So I’ve done , among other things , a hut on Het Heike and also that barn with a moss-covered roof in Roosendaalseweg , which here they call the Protestant barn . Perhaps you’ll recall what I mean .
Then the mill nearby , in the meadow opposite , and the elm trees in the cemetery .
And also one with woodcutters working in a wide open space where a large pine-wood has been cut down . I’m also trying to draw the implements , such as a cart , plough , harrow , wheelbarrow &amp ; c . &amp ; c .
The one with the woodcutters turned out the best , and I think it would please you .
Perhaps Rappard will be coming here for a while this summer , I’ve had a letter from him .
In thought a handshake , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
