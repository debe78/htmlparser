Letter|11 December .
My dear friend ,
I haven’t written to you for such a long time that I feel the need to tell you a thousand things to gain forgiveness for my silence . However I’ll begin by asking you to accept my apologies . Since my arrival here I’ve toiled and continue to toil like a negro , hence from six o’clock in the morning to four thirty in the afternoon , I scarcely leave the barracks for long enough to eat
  , I spend the whole time standing in the blazing sun , shouting like a devil , so in the evening it’s with a certain pleasure that I see the moment coming when I can slide between the sheets , hence my shortage of time to write .
I shan’t tell you about my journey , which went very well . Pointless . Like all other countries , Algeria is only interesting for the visitor , from far away , like this , on paper , it comes across badly . Is that true?
 
I’ve been thinking about Bernard . I’ve been working on his behalf as much as possible . The officer who commands my battalion is very well disposed towards him after what I said about him . Tell your friend to come to the 3rd Zouaves , he’ll then surely be near me , and when he does we’ll try to make his life as gentle as the job permits . It’s a great pity that he isn’t here now ,
  because being in charge of the recruits as I am , the task would be a hell of a lot more simplified still .
Guelma is an absolutely indifferent town: any small village in France would be as pleasant . What really is beautiful is nature , the sun , the light , the types of Arabs , these people with billowing robes are superb . But what astonishes me is that , contrary to what you see in Europe , the paintings seem to be composed in the shade with a dark centre
  and corners in the light . It’s just like , if I dare say so , Rembrandt in reverse . At least that’s how I feel about things .
From my window I have a superb view: my horizon is formed by a line of small mountains running parallel from east to west and lost in the blue . From another side , I have a perfectly flat stretch of ground , of a rather indefinable colour , the areas nearest to the eye are yellowish ;
  the parts that fade into the distance melt into violet greys (does this colour actually exist? In any case that’s what it seems to me) , one last ash-grey line , but so thin it would take only a single slender stroke , determines the true depth of the countryside , which is truly very extensive . All of this is marvellous . I wish I could draw so as to depict it , but I can’t , alas .
How are you
  my dear friend , and how is Gauguin finding life down there? Is he getting used to it?
Write to me , if you have the time , you’ll give me very great pleasure .
Of course , I haven’t a single book to cast my eyes over , not even Balzac at 1 franc 2 sous each . What a hole , what a hole! On top of that , impossible to get any . Have you unearthed Bel-ami?
 
Recall me , if you would , to your esteemed brother’s excellent memory . Hearty handshake for Gauguin , and believe me , my dear friend , your entirely devoted and faithful
P . Milliet
2nd Lieut . 3rd Zouaves
Guelma
Place de Constantine .
