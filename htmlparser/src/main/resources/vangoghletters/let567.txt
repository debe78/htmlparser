Letter|My dear Theo,
Don‘t be cross with me that I‘ve come all of a sudden. I‘ve thought about it so much and I think we‘ll save time this way. Will be at the Louvre from midday, or earlier if you like. A reply, please, to let me know when you could come to the Salle Carrée. As for expenses, I repeat, it comes to the same thing. I have some money left, that goes without saying, and I want to talk to you before spending anything. We‘ll sort things out, you‘ll see. So get there as soon as possible. I shake your hand.
Yours truly,
Vincent
