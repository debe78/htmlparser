Letter|My dear Theo ,
I received your letter with the enclosed 100 francs and thank you most sincerely for it . Your letter enlightened me more than all my worrying and fretting about the question of Mauve and HGT . I compliment you on it , because now I believe I understand it better . And , if I understand correctly , what I have to do is go on working calmly without dwelling on it or taking it to heart as much as I did . If I dwell on it , I have the same feeling of dizziness which , you say , someone who hasn’t studied perspective feels when he tries to follow the receding lines in nature and give an account of them . And I believe that just as the whole perspective changes with a change in eye level , which depends not on the objects but on the man viewing them (whether he stoops or stands on top of something) , so too the change in Mauve and H . G . T . is in part only an outward seeming and can be explained by my own mood . I don’t see these affairs clearly , but I think I see plainly from your letter that there’s no reason for me to be overly concerned about it if only I go on working . And now enough about it , because there are other things to write .
Heyerdahl’s sympathy moved me deeply , will you give him my regards and say that I hope very much to make his acquaintance some day , and that I set great store by it .
I’ve now finished two larger drawings . First of all , Sorrow , but in a larger format , the figure alone without surroundings . But the pose has been altered somewhat , the hair doesn’t hang down the back but to the front , part of it in a plait . This brings the shoulder , the neck and back into view . And the figure has been drawn with more care .
The other one , ‘Roots’ , is some tree roots in sandy ground . I’ve tried to imbue the landscape with the same sentiment as the figure .
Frantically and fervently rooting itself , as it were , in the earth , and yet being half torn up by the storm . I wanted to express something of life’s struggle , both in that white , slender female figure and in those gnarled black roots with their knots . Or rather , because I tried without any philosophizing to be true to nature , which I had before me , something of that great struggle has come into both of them almost inadvertently . At least it seemed to me that there was some sentiment in it , though I may be mistaken , anyway , you’ll have to see for yourself .
 
If you see something in them , perhaps they’ll be suitable for your new home , and then I’ll have made them for your birthday , on which I congratulate you . But because they’re rather large (1 whole sheet of Ingres) , I don’t know if I should send them straightaway . Let me know . Perhaps H . G . T . would find it impertinent or priggish if I asked him to pack them in a crate as a return shipment .
Although Roots is only a ‘pencil’ drawing , it has been brushed in and scraped off , the same as one paints .
As regards the carpenter’s pencil , my reasoning is as follows . The old masters , what would they have drawn with? Certainly not with Faber B , BB , BBB , &amp ; c . &amp ; c . , but with a rough piece of graphite . The implement Michelangelo and Dürer used was perhaps very similar to a carpenter’s pencil . But I wasn’t there and don’t know . This I do know , that with a carpenter’s pencil one can achieve intensities differently than with those fine Fabers &amp ; c .
I like graphite better in its natural form than cut too fine in those expensive Fabers . And the shininess disappears by fixing it with milk . If one sits outdoors and works with Conté , one can’t really tell what one’s doing because of the bright light and notices that it’s become too black , but graphite is more grey than black , and one can always obtain a couple of extra octaves by working it over with the pen , so that the strongest intensities of graphite actually lighten up through the repoussoir of the pen .
Charcoal is best , but if one works with it too long it loses its freshness , and to keep the subtlety one has to fix those spots . For landscapes as well , I see that such draughtsmen as Ruisdael , Van Goyen and Calame , Roelofs too , among the moderns , used it to great advantage . But if someone invented a good pen to work with outdoors , with accompanying inkwell , perhaps more pen drawings would be made .
One can do wonderful things with charcoal that has been soaked in oil , I’ve seen this from Weissenbruch . The oil is then the fixative , and the black becomes warmer and deeper . But I imagine it would be better for me to do that in a year and not now , because I want the fine appearance to come from me and not from my material . When I’m a bit further along I’ll put on a nice suit now and then , meaning I’ll work with rewarding drawing materials . And provided I myself am capable of doing something , I’ll make twice as much progress , and perhaps it will prove easier than expected . But first , before any success , hand-to-hand combat with the things in nature .
 
Last year I wrote you a great many letters telling you what I thought about love . I’m not doing so now , because I’m busy putting those same things into practice . The person for whom I felt what I wrote to you is not on my path , is beyond my reach , despite all my longing for her . Would I have done better to go on thinking of her and to overlook what came my way? I cannot decide whether I’m acting consistently or inconsistently . Suppose I were to start today on a drawing of a digger , for example – but the man says , I have to leave and won’t or can’t pose again – I don’t have the right to blame him for leaving me there with a barely sketched drawing , the more so because I started to draw him without asking permission . Must I then give up drawing a digger? I think not , especially not if tomorrow I encounter one who says , I want to come not only today but also tomorrow and the day after , and I understand what you need , go ahead , I’m patient and have the good will to do it . To be sure , I didn’t stick exactly to my first impression , but would I have done better to reason: no , I definitely need that first digger , even if he says , I can’t and won’t? And once I’ve started on No . 2 , then I may certainly not work without reference to the nature standing before me , thinking the while of No . 1 . That’s how things stand . And concerning that , I add this to my previous letter . In order for me to succeed , you’ll have to help me a bit , but I believe the expense would be not more but less than what you’ve been sending me these last few months .
I’d be willing and daring enough to embark on this undertaking if I could count on 150 francs a month for another year . I do hope in that case to earn something as well , but if that were to fail I’d be able to scrape by anyway , though admittedly in straitened circumstances . And then later – when that year has passed? It seems to me that there’s nothing in my work to indicate that I won’t succeed , provided I plough on and continue to make an effort . And I’m not one to work slowly or fretfully . Drawing is becoming a passion with me , and I’m becoming increasingly absorbed in it , and where there is a will is a way .
 
Where is a will is a way , but that has to come from both sides . For me the will must be the making of things , and for those who have or may acquire sympathy for me , the will is selling or buying those things .
The will being there , I think the way can be found . But if everyone reasoned like H . G . T . – ‘unsaleable’ , ‘disagreeable’ – then I’d be confronted with a mountain of trouble . Oh well – be that as it may – I’ll put more effort into my work to defeat the disagreeable and unsaleable .
There’s been a terrible storm here for 3 nights running . In the night from Saturday to Sunday the window of my studio gave out . (The house where I live is very dilapidated . ) 4 large panes broken and the window wrenched loose . You can imagine this wasn’t all . The wind came sailing over the flat pastures directly at my window . The fence below was also knocked down , the drawings ripped from the wall , the easel on the floor . I nevertheless tied the window down with my neighbour’s help , and nailed up a woollen blanket against the opening , certainly a ? metre in size . Didn’t sleep a wink the whole night , as you can imagine . And lots of trouble to fix it because it was Sunday . The is a poor pedlar , he gave me the glass , I paid for the work . All the more reason why I’m thinking of moving next door . There’s an upstairs flat like this:
[sketch A]
The studio is larger than mine , the light very good . There’s an attic , completely panelled over , so that one doesn’t see the roof tiles . Extremely large , where one can partition off as many rooms as one likes (and I have the planks to do it) . Rent 12 . 50 guilders a month , a strong , well-built house , but it won’t bring in any more , because it’s ‘only in Schenkweg’ and the rich people the owner had hoped for won’t come here .
I’d like it very much , and the owner would like to have me rent it ; he spoke to me about it first and then I went to see it .
And now I’ll finish by saying that I assure you I think about home a great deal , and am of the opinion that half a year from now , if the matter about which I wrote to you has been undertaken and Pa and Ma come to visit me , it would result in a change of feeling on both sides . Unfortunately , though , now is not the time , we have to get things started first . Because Pa and Ma , whom I consider to be lay people in the circumstances , will think it very nice if it’s more finished (Belgian merchants say more finessed , according to Mauve) , but the rough sketch , which you’d understand if you’d been here , would make them dizzy at the very least . Adieu – I wish you the best .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
If you’re coming soon , I won’t send the drawings . But it’s time you started to get things from me , I’ll do my best , and if you like these two , for example , you’ll get many more and of all kinds .
If you show the ones you find suitable to the people who come to your room , perhaps that would be the beginning of selling them , and particularly when a number of them are shown together , and various ones by the same hand , they draw attention to one another , and the one complements and explains the other .
What I value most is your sympathy . If I positively win that , the selling will follow . But neither I nor you must force that sympathy .
I believe I can produce a great deal , I mean , work rapidly and not waste time . And if I’ve sent you another couple , since you sent back the old studies as I asked you to do (the Laan van Meerdervoort and Sorrow) , it’s to give you a sign that I can make more of the same if you’d like . If you say they aren’t ready , I’ll go on working before sending more , because what I sent isn’t something accidental: what I can do , I can do . I must go on working for a time to make even more progress . But I want to say this: if the last batch I sent proves to have anything you could begin showing to people , I could start to send you things as soon as I have something . What you considered good would then have to be put into grey mounts , and a portfolio would gradually take shape in this way . Think about it .
I have another drawing of an old man by the fireplace , ‘the boarder’ , an old woman from the Geest district , a couple of female figures which I think would go well with the others . Also small sketches .
I’m not saying this to make you hurry , but it can’t do any harm to think it over .
 
You started helping me without knowing what would come of it , and when others wouldn’t . I do hope that one day you’ll be able to say calmly to those who think it’s foolish of you to help me that you haven’t lost anything by it . And that stimulates me all the more , and I think you should start by taking a few drawings , and every month there will be more . There are days when I make 5 , but with drawings you must count on 1 in 20 succeeding . That 1 in 20 is no longer an accident , though , I can count on that . There will probably be 1 every week about which I feel ‘that will remain’ . For the time being it’s better for you to keep the ones that ‘will remain’ than for me to give them to someone here for 10 guilders or so , and then only by the grace of God and as a great favour . Here everyone criticizes the technique , but I also hear the same platitudes from everyone about English drawings , for example . Weissenbruch alone said , when I told him that I see the things as pen drawings – then you must draw with the pen .
He , namely Weiss . , saw the large rather than the small Sorrow , and he said things about it that pleased me . That’s why I dare to say what I say about the large one . I’ve had no ‘guidance’ , no ‘instruction’ from others , but have taught myself , as it were , so it’s no wonder that on the face of it my way of doing things differs from that of others . But that’s no reason for my work to remain unsaleable . I’ll wager that the large Sorrow , the woman from the Geest district , the boarder and others too , if you will , will indeed find a buyer one day . But it could well be that I’ll work on them again later . I’ve even worked again on the Laan van Meerdervoort . I have a female figure in a black merino frock in front of me , and I’m certain that if you had it for a few days you would become reconciled to its manner and wouldn’t wish it had been done differently .
I didn’t understand English drawings either at first , as little as any other foreigner , but ‘I took the trouble to become acquainted with them’ and haven’t regretted it .
Adieu , enough for today .
