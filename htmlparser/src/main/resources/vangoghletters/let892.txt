Letter|My dear Vincent
On my return from a little trip I found both your letter and your proof etching . De Haan and I had been to spend 5 days in Pont-Aven , my former residence which is 6 leagues from Le Pouldu .
Your letter doesn’t tell me very much: if you’ve seen my canvases in Paris at Goupil’s , what do you think of them! If my planned journey to Madagascar appears unreasonable to you . I dream of it every day , to the point where I’m scarcely working at all at the moment , wanting to rest a little , gain new strength for down there .
 
And you , you’re insatiable ; I see that you haven’t been losing any time in Auvers . It’s good , though , to rest the mind and the body sometimes .
Your idea of coming to Brittany at Le Pouldu seems excellent to me if it could be put into effect . For we are , De Haan and I , in a little hole far from the town . Without any communication other than a hired cart . And for a sick man who needs a doctor , it’s sometimes risky . At Pont-Aven it’s different , there’s a doctor and people . In addition , if I manage to sort things out to go to Madagascar I’ll no longer be here
  at the beginning of September , like De Haan , who’s going to go back to Holland . That , in all honesty , is the situation . And however God knows how much it would please me to see our friend Vincent close to us .
I don’t know Doctor Gachet but I’ve often heard père Pissarro speak of him . And it must be pleasant for you to have someone close to you who sympathizes with your work , your ideas .
Alas , I see myself condemned to be less and less understood , and I must hold fast to following
  my way alone , to drag out an existence without a family like a pariah . So the solitude in the woods seems to me in the future to be a new and almost dreamed-of paradise . The savage will return to savagery .
At last! Destiny once written cannot be overturned .
Friendly greetings from our friend De Haan .
Cordially
Ever yours ,
Paul Gauguin
