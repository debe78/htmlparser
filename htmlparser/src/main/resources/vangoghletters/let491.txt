Letter|Dear Sir ,
I’m not sure whether I can come and paint next Saturday . Because I’m making a couple of studies here — of the potato planting — on which I may possibly have to continue to work on the day in question .
But if not Saturday , I’ll come anyway — unless I hear from you to the contrary — on Monday .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
