Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
When I began collecting woodcuts I often regretted that I didn’t know who they were by if I couldn’t make head or tail of the monograms many English draughtsmen use .
Even now I don’t know everything , but do know a few , and a list of these may be of some use to you , although you may know them all .

But often you find the names in full .
I’m sure I’ve left some out , but these are the ones that come to mind at the moment .
In Harper’s Weekly there are beautiful things by Howard Pyle , Harper , Rogers , Abbey , Alexander among others ; Caton Woodville , Overend , Nash , Dadd , Gregory , Watson , Staniland , Smythe , Hennessy , Emslie you no doubt know from the large drawings in The Graphic and London News .
 
I have a nice thing by Small for you . He’s someone who’s astonishingly clever .
I don’t know whether you know Scribner’s Magazine and Harper’s Monthly Review , there are always highly distinguished things in them .
I have only a few of them at present since they’re quite expensive , and one hardly ever finds them second-hand . The British Workman and The Cottager and Artisan , both penny papers from the London Tract Society , sometimes have very tame things but sometimes strong , beautiful things .
I’d be very glad to hear more details about what you have , when the opportunity arises , for you’re bound to have some that I don’t have , and this whole subject interests me . I would like to see the portrait of Shakespeare by Menzel sooner or later .
Tell me , how are you getting on with your watercolours? I’ve again been very busy with that in the last few weeks , and also with types from the common people .
How beautiful it is outside – I sometimes yearn for a country where it would always be autumn , but then we’d have no snow and no apple blossom and no corn and stubble fields .
Please look and see whether you got a large wood engraving from me in the past , with no draughtsman’s name below it , depicting gentlemen and ladies riding in a park , I believe it’s the Empress of Austria in whose honour a hunting party or something is being given .
If you don’t have it — though I believe you already got it this summer — then I have it twice , for I found another one just a few days ago .
There’s also one by Knaus , a hunter giving his dog a piece of bread .
 
Talking of landscapes , I’ve always liked Birket Foster and Read a lot , even if they’re regarded as old-fashioned .
Among other things by Read I have an autumnal effect and a moonlight and a snow which are very beautiful .
There’s a wide range of approaches to the English landscape . Foster bears little resemblance to Edwin Edwards , but both have their raison d’être . Wyllie and others with him are more colourists , or rather seek the tone more . Especially in Scribner’s Magazine and Harper’s Monthly there are very fine things more in Wyllie’s manner — small seascapes , snow effects &amp ; c . , corners of a garden or street .
Routledges Sixpenny series includes , among others , Oliver Twist illustrated by J . Mahoney , which I highly recommend to you , and Story of a feather illustrated by Du Maurier and Curtain lectures by C . Keene . But in Punch there are better ones by them . Du Maurier is very reminiscent of Menzel , especially in some of his large compositions .
In Belgium at one time , Félicien Rops and Degroux , among others , drew beautiful types in a magazine called Uylenspiegel which I once had and would dearly like to have again , but alas can no longer find . There were things in it , by Degroux especially , that were as beautiful as Israëls .
Well , old chap , I must get to work . I wanted to send you the list of monograms before I misplaced it again . Adieu , do write soon . Believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
