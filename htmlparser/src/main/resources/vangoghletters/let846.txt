Letter|Dear Jo ,
It touches me so much that you write to me so calmly and so much master of yourself on one of your difficult nights . How I long to hear that you’ve come through safely and that your child lives . How happy Theo will be , and a new sun will rise in him when he sees you recovering . Forgive me if I tell you that to my mind recovery takes a long time and is no easier than being ill . Our parents knew that too , and following them in that is , I believe , what one calls duty . Well for my part , I’m thinking about all of you these days .
I’m better , but have again had a few days like the other , that’s to say that I didn’t know exactly how I was , and was upset .
But you see that calm is returning .
 
I read Theo’s letter with 50 francs enclosed at the same time as your letter ; he writes things to me that give me a great deal of pleasure . And I hope to send him a new batch of my work before long .
But how I’m longing to hear of the good outcome to your struggle .
Tell him that I’ve had a good letter from Gauguin .
And if Wil’s still with you , which I suppose , tell her that I’ve received her letter and hope to answer it soon .
She’ll be so happy , too , if it goes well with you and your baby , and it’s very good indeed to be present at such events .
 
And Ma in Leiden will rejoice in it more than anyone else , because she’s longed for so long , I believe , that things were rather happier for him . Well , I’ll be glad when I can congratulate Theo and , and will hope that it’s already the case .
So much with you and them in thought
Your brother
Vincent
I won’t write any more , because I’m still not entirely calm . More soon .
