Letter|My dear Theo ,
On my side , too , it’s more than time that I wrote to you with a rested mind for once . Thanks first of all for your kind letter and for the 100-franc note it contained . Our days pass in working , working always , in the evening we’re worn out and go to the café before retiring to bed early . That’s our existence . Naturally it’s winter here too , although the weather still continues to be very fine from time to time . But I don’t find it disagreeable to try to work from the imagination , since that permits me not to go out . Working in the heat of a stove doesn’t bother me , but the cold isn’t for me , as you know . Only I’ve spoiled that thing I did of the garden at Nuenen and I feel that habit is also necessary for works of the imagination . But I’ve done the portraits of an entire family , the family of the postman whose head I did before – the , his , the , the boy and the 16-year-old , all characters and very French , although they have a Russian look . No . 15 canvases . You can sense how in my element that makes me feel , and that it consoles me to a certain extent for not being a doctor .
 
I hope to persevere with this and be able to obtain more serious sittings , which can be paid for with portraits .
And if I manage to do this entire family even better , I’ll have done at least one thing to my taste and personal .
At the moment I’m really in the shit , studies , studies , studies , and that’ll go on for some time yet – such a mess that it breaks my heart – and yet that’ll give me neatness when I’m 40 . From time to time a canvas that makes a painting , such as that sower , which I too think is better than the first one .
If we can withstand the siege , a day of victory will come for us , even though we wouldn’t be among the people who are being talked about . It’s rather a case of thinking of that proverb , joy in town , grief at home .
What can you expect? Supposing that we still have a whole battle to fight , then we must try to mature calmly . You’ve always told me to do more quality than quantity . Now , nothing is preventing us from having a lot of studies classed as such , and consequently not having a whole heap of things for sale . And if sooner or later we’re obliged to sell ,
  then selling at a slightly higher price the things that can hold their own from the point of view of serious research .
I think that – in spite of myself – I won’t be able to prevent myself sending you a few canvases shortly , say within a month . I say in spite of myself , for I’m convinced that the canvases gain from drying right through here in the south , to the point where the impasto is thoroughly hardened , which takes a long time – that’s to say a year . If I restrain myself from sending them that would certainly be best . For we don’t need to show them at the moment , I’m well enough aware of that .
Gauguin works a lot – I very much like a still life with yellow background and foreground . He’s working on a portrait of me which I don’t count as one of his undertakings that don’t come to anything .
At present he’s doing landscapes , and finally he has a good canvas of washerwomen , even very good as I see it .
You should receive two of Gauguin’s drawings in return for 50 francs which you sent him in Brittany . But old Bernard simply appropriated them . Speaking of indescribable stories , this is indeed one . I think that she’ll give them back though in the end .
  Beware of the Bernard family , but you should know that in my opinion Bernard’s work is very fine and that he’ll have some well-deserved success in Paris .
Very interesting that you met Chatrian . Is he blond or dark? I’d like to know that , since I know the two portraits .
In their work , it’s above all Madame Therèse and L’ami Fritz that I like .
As regards L’histoire d’un sous-maître , it seems to me that there’s more to find fault with than seemed possible to me at the time .
I think we’ll end up spending our evenings drawing and writing , there’s more to work on than we can do .
You know that Gauguin has been invited to exhibit at the Vingtistes . His imagination is already leading him to think of settling in Brussels , which would indeed be a means of finding himself in a position to see his Danish again . Since he has some success with the Arlésiennes in the meantime , I wouldn’t consider that as being absolutely without consequences .
He’s married and doesn’t much appear to be , in short I fear there may be an absolute incompatibility of character between his and himself , but naturally he’s more attached to his children , who judging from the portraits are very beautiful . We , on the other hand , aren’t too gifted in that respect . More soon , a handshake for you and for the Dutchmen .
Vincent
Gauguin will write to you tomorrow , he’s waiting for a reply to his letter and sends his warm regards .
