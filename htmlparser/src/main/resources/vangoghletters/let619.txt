Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m writing to you from Saintes-Maries on the Mediterranean at last — the Mediterranean — has a colour like mackerel , in other words , changing — you don’t always know if it’s green or purple — you don’t always know if it’s blue — because a second later , its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue .
It’s a funny thing , the family — quite unintentionally , and despite myself , I’ve often thought here from time to time of our the seaman , who has certainly seen the shores of this sea many times .
I’ve brought three canvases and I’ve covered them — two seascapes — a view of the village — and some drawings which I’ll send you by post when I get back to Arles tomorrow .
I board and eat for 4 francs a day — they started by asking 6 .
 
As soon as I can I’ll probably come back to do some more studies here .
The beach here is sandy , no cliffs or rocks — like Holland — without the dunes and with more blue .
You eat better fried fish here than beside the Seine — only there isn’t fish to eat every day , as the fishermen go off to sell in Marseille . But when there is some it’s darned good . If there isn’t any — the butcher’s is no more appetizing than Monsieur Gérôme’s fellah butcher’s — if there’s no fish it’s rather hard to find something to eat here , it seems to me .
I don’t believe there are 100 houses in this village or town .
The main building after the old church , an ancient fortress , is the barracks . And what houses at that — like those on our Drenthe heaths and peat bogs , you’ll see some specimens in the drawings .
 
I have to leave my three painted studies here , because of course they aren’t dry enough to subject them to 5 hours’ jolting in a carriage with impunity .
But I expect to come back here .
Next week I’d like to go to Tarascon to do two or three studies .
If you haven’t already written I’ll expect your letter in Arles , of course .
A very handsome gendarme came to interview me here . And the too — people can’t be too bad here , because even the priest seemed almost like a decent fellow .
Next month will be the public bathing season .
Number of bathers varies from 20 to 50 .
I’m staying till tomorrow afternoon , have still got some drawings to do .
 
I took a walk along the seashore one night , on the deserted beach . It wasn’t cheerful , but not sad either , it was — beautiful .
The sky , a deep blue , was flecked with clouds of a deeper blue than primary blue , an intense cobalt , and with others that were a lighter blue — like the blue whiteness of milky ways . Against the blue background stars twinkled , bright , greenish , white , light pink — brighter , more glittering , more like precious stones than at home — even in Paris . So it seems fair to talk about opals , emeralds , lapis , rubies , sapphires . The sea a very deep ultramarine — the beach a mauvish and pale reddish shade , it seemed to me — with bushes . In addition to half-sheet drawings I have a large drawing , the pendant of the last one .
More soon , I hope . Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
