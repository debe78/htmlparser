Letter|My dear Theo ,
Yesterday I sent three packets by parcel post containing studies which I hope you’ll receive in good order . I really must thank you for the 10 metres of canvas , which have just arrived .
Among the studies you’ll find the following , which are for our and . Olive trees – Bedroom – Reaper – Working with plough – Wheatfield with cypresses – Orchard in blossom – Portrait .
The remainder is above all autumn studies and I think the best one is the yellow mulberry tree against a very blue sky . Then the study of the house and of the park , of which there are two variants . The studies on no . 30 canvases weren’t yet dry and will follow later . They’re giving me a lot of trouble , and sometimes I find them very ugly , sometimes they look good to me – perhaps you’ll have the same impression when you see them . There are a dozen of them , so it’s more substantial than what I’ve just sent .
In spite of the cold I’m continuing to work outside up to now , and I think that it’s good for me and for the work .
The last study I did is a view of the village – where people were at work – under enormous plane trees – repairing the pavements . So there are piles of sand , stones and the gigantic tree-trunks – the yellowing foliage , and here and there glimpses of a house-front and little figures .
 
I often think of you and Jo , but with a feeling as if there was an enormous distance from here to Paris and as if it were years since I saw you . I hope that your health is good , for myself I can’t complain , I feel absolutely normal , so to speak , but without ideas for the future , and truly I don’t know what it’s going to be , and perhaps I’m avoiding going into this question deeply , sensing that I can do nothing about it .
I’ve finished , or almost , the copy of The diggers too .
You’ll see that there are no more impastos in the large studies . I prepare the thing with sorts of washes with spirits , and then proceed with touches or hatchings of colour with spaces between them . This imparts atmosphere and uses less paint .
If I want to send this letter off today I must hurry , so handshake in thought and warm regards to Jo .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
