Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thank you for your letter and for the 50-franc note it contained . Thank you for having written me more about those Dutch artists’ painting .
I’ve had gas put in , in the studio and the kitchen , which is costing me 25 francs for installation . If Gauguin and I work every evening for a fortnight , won’t we earn it all back again? But since , what’s more , G . may come any day now , I’ll absolutely absolutely need at least another 50 francs .
I’m not ill , but I’d become so without any doubt if I didn’t take hearty food and if I didn’t stop painting for a few days . In fact , I’m once again nearly reduced to the state of madness of Hugo van der Goes in Emile Wauters’s painting .
  And if it wasn’t for the fact that I had something of a dual nature , something of both the monk and the painter , I should be — and that long since — utterly and entirely reduced to the above-mentioned state .
But even for all that , I don’t believe that my madness would be of the persecution kind , since my feelings in a state of excitement have more to do with preoccupations about eternity and eternal life .
But even so , I must be wary of my nerves , &amp ; c .
I only say that because you’d be wrong to believe that I’d have had the slightest wariness about these two Dutch painters . But in truth , it’s only after your second letter that I can form an idea of what they’re doing , and I’m very curious to see the photographs of their drawings .
 
I have a great urge to write you a letter just so that you can have them read it , to explain once again why I myself believe in the south for the future and the present .
And at the same time to say how strongly I believe that we’re right to see in the Impressionist movement a tendency towards great things , and not only a school that would limit itself to making optical experiments . Similarly with those who do history painting , then , or at least have done it in the past ; while there are some very bad history painters , like Delaroche and Delort , are there not also good ones , like E . Delacroix and Meissonier?
Well then , since I have the firm intention not to paint for at least 3 days , perhaps I’ll rest by writing to you and to them at the same time . Because you know that that interests me a good deal , the influence that Impressionism will have on Dutch painters and on Dutch art lovers .
 
Here’s very rough croquis of my last canvas . A row of green cypresses against a pink sky with a pale lemon crescent moon .
Foreground a piece of waste land , and some sand and a few thistles . Two lovers , the man pale blue with a yellow hat , the woman has a pink bodice and a black skirt . That makes the fourth canvas of the ‘poet’s garden’ , which is the decoration for Gauguin’s bedroom .
It horrifies me to have to ask you for money again , but I can do nothing about it , and what’s more , I’m worn out again . However , I’d believe that the work that I’m doing while spending a little more will one day seem to us less costly than my previous work .
Besides , I’d already told you that if the thing had been possible , to do a deal with Thomas , I’d have had a strong desire to be able to put even 200 more into the work before Gauguin’s arrival .
As that couldn’t be done , I nevertheless pressed ahead as far as I could with what I had on the go , in a strong desire to be able to show him something new . And not to fall under his influence (because of course he’ll have an influence on me , I hope) before being able to show him beyond any doubt my own originality . He’ll see that anyway from the decoration as it is now .
Please , at least if the thing’s possible for you , send me another fifty francs right away ; I don’t quite know how I’ll be able to get by otherwise . I’m pleased that you’ve read Tartarin again . Anyway . I hope you’ll be able to write to me no later than by return of post . I shake your hand firmly .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
