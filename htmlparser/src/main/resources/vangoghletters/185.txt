Dear Brother ,
I think that if I didn’t give vent to my feelings once in a while the boiler would burst . I must tell you something that would perhaps drive me mad if I kept it to myself but perhaps doesn’t have to weigh so heavily on my mind if only I speak openly about it . As you know , Pa and Ma on the one hand and I on the other don’t agree about what should or should not be done about that certain ‘no , nay , never’ .
Well , after hearing for a long time the rather crass expressions ‘indelicate and untimely’ (imagine that you loved someone and that love was called ‘indelicate’ , wouldn’t you stand up to that with a certain measure of pride and say , Enough!) , and this had stopped at my express request not to use those expressions any longer , something else became the order of the day .
Now it was said ‘that I would break ties’ . Well , I’ve said many times with seriousness , with patience , with feeling , that this wasn’t the case at all . This helped for a time , but then it started all over again .
What I did , in fact , was ‘write letters’ , behold the actual offence .
But when (so overhastily and stupidly , in my opinion) that awful expression ‘breaking ties’ went on and on , I did the following .
 
For a couple of days I spoke not a word and took not the slightest notice of either Pa or Ma . Reluctantly , but still , I wanted to make them feel what it would be like if ties really were broken .
Naturally my behaviour surprised them , and when they told me so I answered , You see , this is how it would be if there were no bond of affection between us , but fortunately it does exist and won’t be so easily broken for the present , but now see for yourself , I beg you , how wretched words like ‘breaking ties’ really are , and don’t say them any more .
The result , though , was that Pa became very angry , sent me out of the room and – and – cursed me , at least that’s what it sounded like!
It causes me much sorrow and grief but I refuse to accept that a father is right who curses his son and (think of last year) wants to send him to a madhouse (which I naturally opposed with all my might) and calls his son’s love ‘untimely and indelicate’!!!
 
When Pa gets angry he’s used to having people , me included , admit that he’s right . Now , though , I’d firmly resolved to let his anger burst forth , for God’s sake .
Also IN ANGER , Pa said something about my having to move somewhere else , but because it was said IN ANGER I don’t attach much importance to it .
Here I have my models and my studio , life would be more expensive elsewhere , and working more difficult and models costlier . But if Pa and Ma said to me calmly , leave , of course I would leave .
There are things that a man cannot take lying down . If one were to let himself be told ‘you’re a madman’ or ‘you’re someone who breaks family ties’ or you’re ‘indelicate’ , then anyone with a heart in his body would protest with all his might . I also said something to Pa and Ma , namely that in the matter of this love of mine they were very wrong and their heart was very hardened and they seemed entirely insensible to a milder and more humane view . That , in a word , their view seemed to me to be bigoted and not broad-minded and generous enough , also that it seemed to me that the word ‘God’ would have only a hollow ring to it if one had to conceal love and wasn’t allowed to follow one’s heart’s promptings .
 
Well , I’ll gladly believe that at times I couldn’t hide my indignation upon hearing ‘indelicate’ or ‘breaking ties’ , but who would remain calm if it didn’t stop?
In any event , Pa , in his anger , muttered neither more nor less than a curse .
But I already heard something similar last year , and thank God , far from being damned in reality , new life and new energy developed in me . So I have every confidence that it will be like that now as well , only more and stronger than last year .
Theo , I love , her and no other , her for ever . And – And – And – Theo , even though the ‘no , nay , never’ still ‘appears’ to be in full force , there’s a feeling of deliverance in me , and it’s as though she and I had ceased to be two people and had been united for eternity .
HAVE MY DRAWINGS ARRIVED? I made another one yesterday , a peasant lad , in the morning , lighting the fire in the hearth where the kettle hangs , and another one , an old man laying dry twigs on the fire . I’m sorry to say that there’s still something stiff and severe in my drawings , and I think that she , namely her influence will be needed to soften that . Now , old chap , I don’t see any reason to take ‘the curse’ so very seriously , perhaps I availed myself of too harsh a means to make Pa and Ma feel something they didn’t want to hear , but isn’t ‘a father’s curse’ much more crass and harsh , really too bad! Anyway , I shake your hand , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
