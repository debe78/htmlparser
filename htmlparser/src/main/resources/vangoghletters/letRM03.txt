Letter|Afternoon in February
The day is ending
The night descending
The marsh is frozen
The river dead.
Through clouds like ashes
The red sun flashes
On village windows
That glimmer red.
And through the meadows
Like fearful shadows
Slowly passes
a funeral train.
Longfellow
 
Three kingsdaughters fair
Fly away my heart away
Sweet appleblossoms bloom
So sweet so sweet.
Ah says the eldest one
Fly away my heart away.
The days began so sweet
So sweet.
Ah says the second one
Fly away my heart away
Far off I hear the drum
So sweet.
Ah says the youngest one
Fly away my heart away
’t Is my true love my own
So sweet.
