Letter|My dear friend Boch ,
Many thanks for your letter , which gave me great pleasure . I congratulate you on not having hesitated this time — and on having tackled the Borinage . That’s a field in which you’ll be able to work for the whole of your life , the extraordinary landscape as well as the human figure!
The female thrutchers in pit-rags , in particular , are superb . If you ever go to Petit-Wasmes , would you find out if Jean Baptiste Denis (farmer) and Joseph Quinez (miner) are still living there , and tell them on my behalf that I’ve never forgotten the Borinage , and that I’ll always have a wish to see it again? Now I have to tell you some news , that is that I’ve at last furnished the house and that I immediately furnished a bedroom for Gauguin as well , or for whoever will come .
The house is much more cheerful now that it’s furnished . Afterwards I worked at full tilt , because the autumn is windless and superb . And so I have 7 square no . 30 canvases on the go . First of all the night café where I stayed , with lamp effects — painted at night .
 
3 views of the public garden in front of my house .
Here’s one of those views . A round cypress or Cedar bush in bottle green . In the lemony green lawn .
At the back , a row of oleanders and 2 small figures . A blue sky in raw cobalt . You can see that it’s much simpler than before .
And ploughed fields , a landscape with nothing but clods of earth , the furrows the colour of an old clog under the forget-me-not sky with white flecks .
And a view of my house and its surroundings under a sulphur sun , the sky hard , bright cobalt . That’s a difficult one!
And a view of the café on place du Forum , where we used to go , painted at night .
And lastly , a study of the Rhône , of the town under gaslight and reflected in the blue river .
With the starry sky above — with the Great Bear — with a pink and green sparkle on the cobalt blue field of the night sky , while the light of the town and its harsh reflections are of a red gold and a green tinged with bronze .
  Painted at night .
The garden with the oleanders and the round bush is impasted like barbotine .
Your portrait is in my bedroom , with the one of Milliet the Zouave that I’ve just done . I’d very much like to ask you to do an exchange with me of one of your studies of the coal-mines . Wait , I’ll send you a study first then , which I’m sure will be one of those that will seem entirely unfamiliar to you . Because if you saw the night studies , you’d perhaps like them better than the studies of sunlight . Well , let me decide . Because I sincerely hope that our relationship , once embarked upon , will last for good .
Because everything you do will be of extraordinary interest to me , since I so much love that sad region of the Borinage , which will always be unforgettable to me .
If I come to Paris next year , then I’m more or less determined to push on as far as Mons . And perhaps to my own country , to do places there that I knew before . Thus , in the Borinage , Marcasse or St-Antoine at Petit-Wasmes . And then the Cour de l’Agrappe , at your place in Frameries . In short , it was in the Borinage that I began to work from nature for the first time . But I destroyed all that long ago , of course .
But it touches my heart that in the end all these places are going to be painted .
You’ll see how the ideas will come to you . I’m writing to you in great haste , but I wanted to reply right away .
 
Included herewith a very bad croquis of the starry night . All these paintings are square no . 30 canvases .
Had you stayed here until now you’d have taken away other studies . Because I tell you , nature has been extraordinarily beautiful . More than once I’ve done a no . 30 canvas in a day , but then it was the case that from morning till sunset I didn’t move from the sitting except to eat a bite .
My brother wrote to me that he had seen you in passing . Ah well , next year I sincerely hope that we’ll meet again ; above all don’t forget to write me your address if you move house , or give me your precise permanent address — at la Louvière , if I remember rightly . Because it will be excellent to work with continuity in the coal-fields and then , in order to see something entirely different , to come to the region of oleanders and the sulphur sun .
Is your also going to do miners? There’s certainly work for two people there . I believe that it’s very fortunate for you that the two of you both do painting in your house .
Ah well , I have to go to work in the vineyard , near Montmajour . It’s all purplish yellow green under the blue sky , a beautiful , colour motif . Good handshake and good luck , and much success in your work .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Pardon my great haste ; I don’t even have time to re-read the letter .
