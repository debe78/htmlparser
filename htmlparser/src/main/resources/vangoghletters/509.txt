Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter and the enclosure , which is exactly what I meant and enables me to work at the end of the month just as at the beginning of the month .
I was very pleased to hear that Serret is the painter about whom you had previously written things that I had really remembered , but the name had escaped me . I’d like to write much more to you than I will in this letter , but when I get home nowadays I’m really not in the mood for writing when I’ve been sitting in the sun all day . As to what Serret says , I think so too — I’ll drop him a line , because I’d like to become friends with him . As I already told you , these days I’m hard at work on figure drawings — I’ll send them specifically with an eye to Serret , to show him that I’m far from indifferent to the unity of a figure and the form .
Do you ever see Wallis? Might the watercolour of the auction be something for him? If it were something for Wisselingh , then better he should take it . I once gave Wisselingh a couple of heads and also just sent him the lithograph . But because he didn’t send so much as a word in reply , I think that all I’d get would be an insult if I sent something .
 
It just happened to me that , having not heard anything from him in 3 months or so , I suddenly got a letter from Rappard , with whom I’ve been on good terms for years , so supercilious and so full of insults and , it seemed to me , so obviously written after he’d been in The Hague that I’m as good as certain that I’ve lost him as a friend for good .
It’s precisely because I tried it first in The Hague , that’s to say my own country , that I have every right and reason to forget all that unpleasantness and to think of something else outside my own country .
You know Wallis well , so perhaps you could bring it up sometime apropos of that watercolour , but act as the opportunity arises . If I could earn something with my work , if we had some firm ground , even a little — under our feet , to be able to go on living — and if ever the desire to become an artisan took shape in you — let me say to make it clear —
  in the manner of , say , discounting all the differences in age &amp ; c . — Hennebeau in Germinal — what you would be able to paint then! Still , the future’s always other than one thinks , so one can never know for sure . The drawback to painting is that if one doesn’t sell one’s paintings one still has to have money for paints and models to make progress . And that drawback is ugly . But otherwise — painting and , to my mind , particularly painting peasant life , gives peace of mind , even though one has a lot of scraping along and wretchedness on the outside of life . I mean painting is a home , and one doesn’t have that homesickness , that peculiar thing that Hennebeau had .
The passage I copied out then struck me very much because , almost literally at that time , I had just such a longing to be something like a grass-mower or polder worker .
 
And I was sick of the boredom of civilization . It is better , one is happier if one puts it into effect — but pretty much literally — at least one feels really alive . And it is something to be deep in the snow in winter , to be deep in the yellow leaves in the autumn , to be deep in the ripe wheat in the summer , to be deep in the grass in the spring . It is something to always be with the mowers and the peasant girls , in summer with the big sky above , in the winter by the black fireplace . And to feel -– this has always been so and always will be . One may sleep on straw , eat rye bread — well then , in the long run one is the healthier for it .
I’d like to write more but — as I said — I’m not really in the mood for writing , and I wanted to enclose a note for Serret , which you must just read , since I write in it about what I wanted to send before long , especially because I want to let Serret see my particular figure studies . Regards ,
Yours truly ,
Vincent
Serret may agree with you that making good things and selling are quite separate . But there’s no truth in that . When the public saw Millet at last , his work collected together — then the public in both Paris and London was enthusiastic . And who was it who had stood in the way and rejected Millet? — the dealers — the so-called experts &amp ; c . I ask you , would a Mouret have said something like that , to keep talking about business?
