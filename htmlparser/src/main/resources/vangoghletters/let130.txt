My dear Theo ,
It felt wonderful to hear Gladwell’s voice in the hall as I sat upstairs studying and to see him a moment later and to shake his hand . Yesterday we took a nice walk through the main streets and past most of the churches , and got up this morning before 5 to see the people coming to the dockyard and afterwards walked to Zeeburg and also saw a cemetery and went to the Trippenhuis (twice) and he alone to Van der Hoop , and he was also at Uncle Cor’s gallery (who isn’t in town , however) and with Mendes in the room . Now we also have plans to go to Uncle Stricker’s (because I’ve been invited to eat there today and will simply risk it and take him along) , and if we have time also to see Vos and Kee . And I would also like very much to go with him to Bickerseiland , but perhaps there won’t be time . Have also strongly suggested that he go to Haarlem to see the paintings by Frans Hals , and now he’s going there and not to Antwerp as he had planned , but will save Belgium for later and is concentrating now exclusively on Holland .
We also spent a lot of time in the little study and talked of things new and old .
When he’s sitting beside me I again feel the same feeling that drew me to him so often , as though he were a son of the same family and a brother in faith because he loves ‘the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief’ . Who is our God and in Whose teachings and resurrection we believe , Whose spirit we seek , of Whose love we ask that it constrain us in life and that nothing separate us from it , nor things present , nor things to come . In him , too , godly sorrow shall work that which in many it has worked and works and shall work , a choice not to be repented of , for that good part which shall not be taken away , and choosing the only thing necessary and worthy of bringing forth fruits meet for repentance . He is a Christian and will become one more and more . This morning we read together the story of Elijah by the brook Cherith and at the widow’s – because when we lived together in Montmartre we found that the barrel of meal did not waste and the cruse of water did not fail – and yesterday evening the parable of the sower and others . Now he’ll stay with you for a while as well , and is longing to see your little room and what you have in the way of prints .
Received from him Bunyan , The pilgrim’s progress , that is an asset , as is Bossuet , Oraison funèbres , which I recently bought very cheaply , and The imitation by T . a Kempis in Latin , which I got from Vos and which I hope to be able to read in Latin some day .
 
He read here various bits of Bungener , Esquiros , Lamennais , Souvestre , Lamartine (Cromwell) , and took pleasure in the lithographs after Bosboom , we bought one from a Jew , and he gave me instructions to buy some more for him when the opportunity presents itself .
I sincerely hope that you’ll have a pleasant evening with him , and I believe that the more you seek in him the more you will find in him .
We talked about this and that , and what we said to each other is this: many , having come to a point in life where one must make a choice about life , have chosen for their part ‘the love of Christ and poverty’ , or rather ‘give me neither poverty nor riches , feed me with bread convenient for me’ . The time together flew past for me , and I wished we could have stayed together a little longer ; but it cannot be , and everyone must return to his way and continue to do whatsoever the hand findeth to do in the calling wherein he was called , and I for my part am thankful from the bottom of my heart that I was able to see him again , and found in him that which drew me to him . He told me that you will certainly make the trip with the nouveautés , probably in about 4 weeks’ time , so I also hope to see you again then .
I sincerely hope that he’ll have pleasant and good memories of his visit to Holland , it’s courageous of him to have persisted with that plan .
Give my regards to your housemates , have a good evening with him ; should wish for you to be attached to him as I feel attached to him at the moment , and accept in thought a handshake from
Your most loving brother
Vincent
You’ve no doubt heard about the death of Mrs Richard ; it must have been a difficult night .
To learn the Bible well and thoroughly and with love , would that not be a very desirable thing?
