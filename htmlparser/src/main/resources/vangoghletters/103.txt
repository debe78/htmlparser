My dear Theo ,
The hours we spent together passed quickly , that small path behind the station where we saw the sun going down over the fields and the evening sky reflected in the ditches , and where those old moss-covered tree-trunks are standing , and the little mill in the distance – I’ll walk there again and think of you .
Herewith the photograph of ‘The Huguenot’ ; hang it up in your room . You know the story , how a young man , on the day before St Bartholomew’s Eve , was warned by his girl , who knew what would happen that night , how she wanted him to wear the sign by which Catholics were recognized , a white arm-band . He didn’t want to do it , though , his religious beliefs and his duty were dearer to him than his girl .
Don’t know if I already sent you that poem by Longfellow which I herewith copy out , it has often held a strong attraction for me , and will perhaps for you , too .
Am glad that we saw Scheffer’s paintings together ; that evening I went to see Mager , who lives with the lay reader of the Lutheran church in a truly old Dutch house . He has a nice room there , we sat together for a long time
  talking , he told me about Menton and about a Christmas he had spent there , and I told him about ‘The wide , wide world’ , which is such a beautiful book .
Thanks for coming here yesterday , and do let’s carry on having as few secrets as possible . We’re brothers , after all .
Had rather a lot of work today , a great many trifling matters – but they’re my duty – if one had no sense of duty , who would be able to collect his thoughts at all , but a sense of duty sanctifies things and joins them together , and turns many small things into one large one .
Write soon about how you got home , and whether that walk and the journey didn’t exhaust you too much . Am longing for a letter from you , also to hear whether you’ll be going to Etten .
Accept in thought a handshake , and believe me
Your loving brother ,
Vincent
 
The light of stars .
The night is come , but not too soon ,
And sinking silently
All silently the little moon
Drops down beneath the sky .
There is no light in earth or heaven
But the cold light of stars
And the first watch of night is given
To the red planet Mars .
Is it the tender star of love
The star of love and dreams
Oh no! from that blue tent above
A hero’s armour gleams .
And earnest thoughts within me rise
When I behold afar
Suspended in the evening skies
The shield of that red star .
O star of strength I see thee stand
And smile upon my pain
Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand
And I am strong again .
Within my breast there is no light
But the red light of stars
I give the first watch of the night
To the red planet Mars .
The star of the unconquered will
He rises in my breast
Serene and resolute and still
And calm and selfpossessed .
 
And thou too , whosoe’er thou art
That readest this brief psalm
As one by one thy hopes depart
Be resolute and calm .
O , fear not in a world like this
And thou shalt know ere long
Know , how sublime a thing it is
To suffer and be strong .
As sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing .
After years of city toil
I hear the old church bells
They sing a strange new song
Whilst the old song in my memory dwells
A strange new song , with strange new words
That many sorrows bring
And sorrowful I once again
Will rejoice at what they sing .
On this man will I look , saith the Lord , even on him that is poor and needy and sorrowful and that trembleth at My word .
Father , we pray not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world , but that Thou shouldest deliver us from the evil .
The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
The Lord is not far from every one of us .
And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it . O Lord , join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger .
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
The devil is never so black that one cannot look him in the face .
The same lips that spoke ‘be harmless as doves’ followed it immediately with ‘and wise as serpents’ .
Come unto Me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . Take my yoke upon you , and learn of Me that I am meek and lowly in heart , for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . If any man will come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow Me .
If any man hate not , even his own life also , he cannot be My disciple .
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut the door , pray to thy Father which seeth in secret . Anoint thine head , and wash thy face , that thou appear not unto men , and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly . We know not what we should pray , but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered , that our faith may not fail when our soul greatly desires to be sifted as wheat . Because ye are sons , God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying in us , Abba , Father . Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
The child puts great faith in his Father
As befits the father’s worth .
For who is closer than thy Father
In Heaven or on earth?
And He passed through the midst of them and said , Mine hour is not yet come .
In the kingdom of Heaven they neither marry , nor are given in marriage . In Christ there is neither male nor female: but He is all , and in all .
