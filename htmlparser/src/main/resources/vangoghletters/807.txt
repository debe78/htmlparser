My dear Vincent ,
I’ve delayed too long in writing to you to tell you that your last consignment arrived in good order . I very much like the wheatfield and the mountains , which are drawn with great expression . There is in the wheatfield that unshakeable side that nature has , even in its wildest
  aspects . The orchard is very beautiful too . Isaäcson , who has lately been writing in a Dutch newspaper , would like to write about your works . He’s asked me if he may have certain things at his home , among others the mountains and the wheatfield . When I send you the reproductions of Millet I’ll enclose Isaäcson’s articles , I don’t like his researches into new words , but basically he talks of good things , which the majority of art critics do not . Your letter gives me much pleasure , and I thank you very much for it . I can certainly feel that being surrounded by the nuns in moments of
  great agitation must not have a calming effect on you .
Dr Peyron came to see me , and he seems well disposed towards you . I like his physiognomy very much . Here’s what he told me . He doesn’t consider you mad at all , and says that the crises you have are of an epileptic nature . For the moment he says that you’re absolutely healthy , and if it weren’t such a short time since you’d had a crisis he would already have encouraged you to go outside the establishment more often . He tells me that as your trip to Arles brought on a crisis one would have to see if you can now bear a change before changing residence .
  If you bear these ordeals well , he sees nothing against your leaving him .
Now I’ve seen Pissarro and I’ve talked to him about the matter . I think that he doesn’t have much to say at home , where his wears the trousers . After a few days he told me that it wasn’t possible at his home , but that he knows someone in Auvers , who’s a and does painting in his free moments . He tells me that he’s a man who has been in touch with all the Impressionists . He thinks that you could probably stay at his home . He’ll go and see him and speak to him about the matter . If you could find something around there , that would be a good thing , for I think that Brittany also has this cloister-like quality , and one feels that a lot even in the latest Gauguin , I find . Tomorrow Bernard is to come and see your paintings , and I’ll go to his home to see what he’s brought back .
All in all I’m happy that you’re better , if your change of residence brought you first to Paris , that would give me great pleasure .
We have good news of Mother and of Wil . Jo is well too , and sends warm regards . Good handshake .
Theo
