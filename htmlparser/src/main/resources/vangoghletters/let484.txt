Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for the prompt dispatch of the money for this month , arriving promptly like that actually helps me more . Thanks , too , for the splendid woodcut after Lhermitte — one of the few things by him that I know , for I saw only these — a troop of girls in the wheat — an old woman in church — and a miner or some such in a little bar , and Harvest by him , and otherwise never anything , and nothing ever as much reflecting his actual manner as these woodcutters .
If Le Monde Illustré prints a composition by him every month — this is part of a series of ‘Rural months’ — it would give me mighty great pleasure to collect this whole series , and I’d really like you to send them every time .
Because obviously I never see anything here , and after all I do need to see something really beautiful now and then , and so another time feel free to keep back 20 francs , say , but send me things like this when they appear in the illustrated magazines .
 
Now as to when you write that if I had something ready that I thought was good , you would try to enter it for the Salon — I appreciate your wanting to do this .
This in the first place — and then further that if I’d known it 6 weeks earlier , I would have tried to send you something for this purpose .
Now , though , I don’t have anything that I would care to send in . Recently , as you know , I’ve painted heads almost exclusively . And they are studies in the true meaning of the word — that is , they’re meant for the studio .
Nonetheless , this very day I’ve started to make some that I’ll send you .
Because I think it possible that it might be of use , when you meet a good many people on the occasion of the Salon , if you had something you could show — albeit only studies .
 
So you’ll receive heads of an old and a young woman , and probably more than one of these two models . Given what you write of your feelings about various conceptions of heads , I think that these , which come straight out of a cottage with a moss-grown thatched roof , won’t appear to you to be absolutely inappropriate , although they’re studies and nothing else . If I’d known 6 weeks earlier , I would have made a woman spinning or spooling yarn — full length — of them .
To return for a moment to that question of the female heads in the Jacquet genre , not the earlier ones but of the present day . The reaction against them — certainly with a motive — by people who paint heads of girls like our sisters , for instance — I can well understand that there are painters who do such things — Whistler did it well several times — Millais , Boughton — to mention only people by whom I saw something of the sort in the past . I know little by Fantin-Latour , but what I saw I thought very good . Chardin . And that’s a lot . For my part , though , I’m not the sort of character who has much chance of getting on a sufficiently intimate footing with girls of that sort that
  they’re willing to pose . Particularly not with my own sisters . And am possibly also prejudiced against women who wear dresses . And my province is more those who wear jackets and skirts .
Though I think what you say about it is true — namely that it’s perfectly possible to paint them — and it has a raison d’être as a reaction against the present-day Jacquet and Van Beers &amp ; c .
Just this , though — Chardin (let’s sum up the aim of the reaction in his name , Fantin-Latour , at least , would approve) , Chardin was a Frenchman and painted French women . And in my view , respectable Dutch women like our sisters really do extraordinarily often lack the charm that the French frequently have .
Consequently , the so-called respectable element among Dutch women isn’t really so very attractive — to paint or to think about . But certain common servant girls , on the other hand , are very Chardin .
At present I’m painting not just as long as there’s light , but even in the evening by lamplight in the cottages , if I can somehow make things out on my palette , in order to capture if possible something of the singular effects of lighting at night , for instance with a large shadow cast on the wall .
I’ve certainly not seen anything in the last few years as fine as those woodcutters by Lhermitte .
How his little figures in that composition are felt and wanted .
Thanks again for it .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
The Chardin is , it seems to me , a singular expression of simplicity and of goodness — both through and through , and I find it a little hard to believe that one would find it in our sisters , say , either one of them . But if Wil were a Frenchwoman rather than a minister’s daughter , she could have it . But as good as always sails to the opposite point of the compass .
