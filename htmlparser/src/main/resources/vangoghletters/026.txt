Letter|London , 21 July 1874 .
My dear Theo ,
Yesterday a crate was sent to The Hague in which I put a photo of a J . Maris and also ‘The landlady’s daughter’ I promised , both of which I hope you’ll hang up in your room .
There’s a photo in the same crate of a Thijs Maris for Mr Tersteeg .
Schüller at Paris sent me 6 copies of both , which I needed in order to give away . I can’t spare another of the Thijs Maris .
Anna and I arrived in London safe and sound , and will manage here somehow .
 
I’m not saying that we’ll find something quickly , but each day that she’s here she learns something , and in any case I believe there’s more chance of her finding something here than in Holland .
It’s wonderful for me to walk with her through the streets in the evening ; I then find everything here just as beautiful as I did when I first arrived .
I wish you well , old chap , and give my regards to Rooses , Haanebeeks and Carbentuses if you see any of them .
I’m learning to swim .
Write to me whether you’ve begun reading Michelet and what you think of it . That book was a revelation to me . Adieu ,
Vincent
Regards from Anna .
