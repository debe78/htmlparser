Letter|My dear Theo ,
If we take a whole piece of ordinary canvas , this is the net price , which I’ve just found out by chance:
Ordinary rough yellow canvas , No . 0	 
Width two metres	 
Whole piece 10 metres long	 
Price 40 francs
The discount is definitely 25% ;
probably the price from the factory —
at first hand — 33 1/3% .
So here’s an opportunity to check Tasset’s prices . Leaving aside , or not , the 5 metres that I’d requested , the best thing would be to take a whole piece .
Having recently bought some canvases from which I’ll keep the stretching frames , it’s a big saving .
To do a no . 30 canvas — not counting the stretching frame , which I have — the canvas doesn’t cost me 1 . 50 (at the price quoted above) and at present , with the stretching frame , 4 francs . Count 1 franc for the stretching frame — which costs less ; on every no . 30 canvas that makes a difference of 1 . 50 , and more . This extra goes for carriage , which will be 5 francs .
 
See — if you can — what Tasset says when you ask him the price by the piece , but what I’m telling you about the price by the piece is just so , and you’ll be able to compare .
Do you remember among the small drawings a wooden bridge with a washing-place — a view of a town in the background? I’ve just painted that subject in large format .
I must warn you that everyone will find that I work too quickly .
Don’t you believe a word of it .
Isn’t it the emotion , the sincerity of our feeling for nature , that leads us and — if these emotions are sometimes so strong that we work — without feeling that we’re working — when sometimes the brushstrokes come in a sequence and in relation one to another like the words in a speech or a letter —
  then we have to remember that it hasn’t always been like that , and that in the future there will also be quite a few heavy days without inspiration . So we have to strike while the iron’s hot and lay aside the bars we forge .
I don’t yet have half of the 50 canvases fit to be presented in public , and I need all of them by the end of this year .
I know in advance that they’ll be criticized as hasty .
I also know that I very much hope to stick to my argument of the past winter , when we talked about an association of artists .
Not that I still have a great desire or hope to bring it about , but as it was a serious argument , we have to retain our seriousness and retain the right to come back to it , to this question .
If Gauguin weren’t to come to work with me , then I have no other resources to balance my expenses but my work .
 
This prospect only mildly frightens me . If my health doesn’t let me down I’ll do a whole heap of my canvases and out of that lot there’ll be some that will do .
I’m almost reconciled with the orchard , which wasn’t on a stretching frame , and its pendant with the stippling . Out of the whole lot , they’ll do . But I’m working with less trouble in the full heat than back in the spring .
Soon I’ll send you some rolled canvases , and the rest as and when it’s possible to roll them up .
I’d very much like to double the order for the zinc whites . This zinc white is part of the reason why everything dries so slowly , but it has other advantages in the mixtures .
 
Wasn’t it pleasant at Guillaumin’s last winter — finding the landing and even the stairs , not to mention the studio — chock-full of canvases? You understand since then that I have a certain ambition , not about the number of canvases , but that these canvases as a whole should , after all , represent a real labour on your part as well as mine .
The wheatfields — that has been an opportunity to work , like the orchards in blossom .
And I only just have time to prepare myself for the new campaign , the one on the vineyards .
And between the two I’d like to do some more seascapes .
The orchards represented pink and white ,
the wheatfields yellow ,
the seascapes blue .
Perhaps now I’ll have a try at doing greens . Now autumn — that gives you the whole range of tones .
 
I’m quite curious to know what Gauguin will do — the main thing is not to discourage him — I still think his whole plan was just a whim .
Do you know what I’d like to tell you once again — this — that my personal desires are subordinate to the interests of a number of people , and that it always seems to me that another person could benefit from the money I spend by myself . Either Vignon , or Gauguin , or Bernard , or someone else .
And that for these arrangements , even if they’d involve my moving , I’m prepared . Two people who get along don’t spend — and even three — much more than one .
No more on colours , either .
So — without counting the surplus of finished works — there would be the satisfaction for you of providing for two or three people instead of one .
 
This for sooner or later . And as long as I’m as strong as the others . You can be sure of this , that it would be hard for us to be deceived , seeing that if they make difficulties about working , I know those difficulties too . And I’d perhaps know what it was all about .
Now , we’d have a perfect right — and perhaps even a duty — to urge them to work .
And that’s what we have to do .
If I’m alone , my word , I can’t do anything about that — then I have less need for company than for frantic work , and that’s why I’m boldly ordering canvas and paints . And so I only feel life when I’m working at full stretch .
And in company I’d feel a bit less need to do that , or rather , I’d work on more complicated things .
But in isolation I can count only on my excitement at certain moments , and then I let myself
  run to extravagances .
And so the canvases I bought here really not so long ago are almost all covered . When I send you the rolled up canvases you could perhaps take quite a few unimportant things off their stretching frames .
So as to be able , at the end of the year , let’s say , to show 50 of them to Pissarro and the others . And the rest , it’s studies , which will be a source of information , and being thoroughly dried , we can keep them in a portfolio or in a cupboard without their taking up a lot of space .
Handshake to you , and to the pals if you see any of them .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
