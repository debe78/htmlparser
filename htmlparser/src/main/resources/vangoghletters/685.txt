Letter|My dear Theo
Many thanks for your letter and for the 100-franc note it contained . Milliet came this morning too , bringing me the parcel of Japanese prints and others . Among them I love the café-concert on two sheets , with a line of purple female musicians against the yellow-lit wall ; I didn’t know that sheet , what’s more there are several others that were unknown to me ; there’s one — a head of a woman — that must have a good pedigree .
At present I’ve also bought a dressing-table with all the necessaries , and my own little bedroom is furnished .
In the other one — Gauguin’s or another lodger’s — we’ll still need a dressing-table and a chest of drawers , and downstairs I’ll need a large stove and a cupboard .
None of that’s at all urgent , and as a result I can already see the goal , to have the means of having a roof over my head for a good long time .
You wouldn’t believe how much that calms me ; I have such a passion to make — an artist’s house — but a practical one and not the usual studio full of curios .
 
I’m also thinking of planting two oleanders outside the door , in tubs .
Anyway , on this studio we’re probably spending several hundred francs less than Russell , for example , who spends thousands . And actually , even if I had the choice between the two , for my part I’d prefer the few-hundred-francs method , as long as each piece of furniture was four-square and substantial . But still , the room in which I’ll put up those who pass through here will be like a boudoir , and when it’s finished you’ll see that it’s not a haphazard creation , but a job done that way deliberately .
Bing’s text on Japan is a bit dry and leaves something to be desired — he says , there’s a great , typical art , but while he gives a few scraps of it ; he doesn’t do a very good job of making you feel the character of this art . Have you read Madame Chrysanthème yet? The great peace of mind that the house brings me is above all this , that from now on I feel that I’m working by providing for the future ; after me another painter will find
  an enterprise under way . I’ll need time , but my mind is set on making a decoration for the house that will be worth the money I spent in the years during which I didn’t produce .
The portrait of our mother gave me great pleasure because you can see that she’s well and that she still has a very lively expression . Only I don’t like it at all as a real likeness ; I’ve just painted my own portrait , and I have the same ashy coloration , and unless they do us in colour they’ll give an idea of us that’s not very lifelike . Precisely because I’d gone to terrible trouble to find the combination of ashy tones and grey pink , I cannot enjoy the likeness in black . Would Germinie Lacerteux be Germinie Lacerteux without colour? Obviously not . How I’d like to have painted portraits in our family!
For the second time I’ve scraped off a study of a Christ with the angel in the Garden of Olives . Because here I see real olive trees .
 
But I can’t , or rather , I don’t wish , to paint it without models . But I have it in my mind with colour — the starry night , the figure of Christ blue , the strongest blues , and the angel broken lemon yellow .
And all the purples from a blood-red purple to ash in the landscape .
I’ve been to get five no . 30 stretching frames , so I have even more intentions . I’m having the paintings that stay here framed in oak and in walnut . I’ll need time , but you’ll see it later . I hope you’ll give me details of your visit to Maurin . I like the drawing of the two women in the cart enormously .
If it took some time before anybody came here with me , it still wouldn’t make me change my mind that it was urgent to take this step , and that in time it will be useful . We feel that the art in which we’re working has a long future yet to come , and so we have to be established like those who are tranquil , and not live like the decadents . Here I’ll have more and more the existence of a Japanese painter , living close to nature like a petit bourgeois . So you can easily tell that it’s less gloomy than the decadents . If I manage to live to quite an old age I’ll be something like père Tanguy . Ah well , as for our personal future , in fact we know nothing about it , but we nevertheless feel that Impressionism will last . More soon , and many , many thanks for all your kindnesses . I think I’ll put the Japanese prints downstairs in the studio .
Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
