Letter|My dear Theo ,
Just a brief word in haste . Have you received the drawings and my later letter yet? I mean the portfolio with the large Sorrow in it and the tree roots &amp ; c .
I hear that Uncle Cent is in Paris — I hope you haven’t discussed the matter in question with him , because you know what terrible gossips they are in Princenhage — having little else to do . Of course they regard this as a ‘demoralization’ , or something even worse . Fine . As long as I don’t have to listen to them and am not present , they can gossip for all I care .
Yesterday I had a friendly letter from Pa and Ma that would give me great pleasure if I could believe this mood would last . However , when I talk to them about the question of Christien (which I’ll definitely do in 3 weeks or so — when she’s in Leiden and I can get away — but not before) , when , I say , they know about one thing and another , will they still speak kindly then??? It isn’t up to them , though , and you know well enough what I think about the matter ; and since I’m not doing anything not permitted by law , and since I doubt their competence to make moral judgements , their refusal would hurt but wouldn’t make me stop or stand still .
 
I’m working again on the drawings for C . M . But will he like them? Perhaps not . I can’t see such drawings as anything other than studies of perspective — and so I’m doing them mainly to practise .
Even if His Hon . doesn’t take them I won’t regret the effort I’m putting into them , because I’d like to keep them myself and get some practice in the matter on which such an enormous amount depends — perspective and proportion .
I’ve been rather weak for the last fortnight and haven’t felt well . I didn’t want to give in to it and carried on regardless . But I couldn’t sleep for several nights on end , and was feverish and nervy . Yet I force myself to keep going and to stay busy , for this is no time to fall ill . I must carry on — Christien and her have moved to a smaller house , because when Christien returns from Leiden she’ll move in with me , wherever I am , whether in better or worse circumstances .
It’s a small house with a courtyard which I hope to do a drawing of this week . With every day that passes I see more and more that the step I’m taking opens up an interesting field for me to draw and find models . People should take this into account if they want to judge me . It’s because of my occupation that I dare do this ; I couldn’t do it if I had a different kind of work .
 
I long for your letter and hope you’ll soon find time to write . It seems to me that you can do a great deal of good in this affair in that , knowing how matters stand (and if you need further information about that , I’ll be happy to provide it as honestly as I can) , in that , as I say , knowing what the position is , you’ll be able to moderate and modify somewhat the judgement of those who will later hear about the matter but still not understand exactly what it’s all about , so that it doesn’t lead to unpleasantness .
For you will understand this — I want to avoid any unpleasantness , gossip or dispute as far as possible — and it was for the sake of peace that I said nothing to anyone except you , and shan’t say more than absolutely necessary , for instance to Pa , until she’s in Leiden .
This isn’t something that I’ve sought myself ; I encountered it on my way and have taken it on , and am glad that what’s required here is to act without hesitation — not to meditate on the matter . And have first shown you the darkest side of the question , in the hope that it won’t look so bad later on .
 
But — I did wish I knew what to do about the studio I wrote to you about . I would also be content with a poorer house , but I don’t know of a more suitable and practical one . And fear that a less practical one wouldn’t really be cheaper , because then my work would suffer , even if I saved a few guilders a month by paying less rent .
And later would probably say , why did I let that studio go and not take more trouble to get it?
More than for a letter , I long for your visit , but I understand that it may have to wait for some time . I’m not really in the mood for writing , but sometimes I have to . If you could send me a little more , it would be good , for things aren’t easy for me . Well , in any case write soon . I would especially like to know what you think about the studio — it could be gone any day . Adieu . Again , don’t inconvenience yourself , but if you can , send me a little more .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
And also write to say whether you’ve received the drawings .
