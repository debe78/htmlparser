Letter|Dear brother ,
I hadn’t intended to write again so soon , but I’m trying to make drawings of various kinds , as you know . And now today I did another sketch with the rest of that piece of natural chalk , and then I gave it a sepia wash . I believe the natural chalk has various characteristics that make it an outstanding means of depicting some things from nature . This morning I went for a walk outside the city in the meadows beyond Zuid Buitensingel , where Maris first lived and where the rubbish dump is . For a long time I stood looking there , in front of a row of the most gnarled , twisted and disoriented pollard willows I’ve ever seen . They lined the edge of a vegetable garden — freshly dug — and were reflected in a small , dirty ditch — very dirty — but where blades of spring foliage were already glittering . But that brown , rough bark — the turned-over earth — in which one could see the fertility , so to speak — all that had something peculiarly warm in the dark , strong tones that again made me think of natural chalk . So that when I have some again I hope to tackle landscape with it .
Although the accompanying sketch is very unfinished , it seemed to me that there could be things in it that corresponded with your intention — and again it’s a sketch from life . Don’t think that I count it a quality if there isn’t enough fullness of detail . Far from it . But the fullness of detail that both you and I would like to see doesn’t consist in details added later , I believe , but should be more present at once than it is now . Because the freshness mustn’t be lost and , provided the impression is correct , there’s sometimes expression in what is relatively unfinished . However , I’ll naturally work at getting more variation in the tones .
I’m relatively indifferent to putting in details , but removing more of the rough edges is definitely my aim . That’s to say , keeping closer to the form .
Although there isn’t enough of that in it yet , there’s still so much difference in the general effect through that little bit of sepia that I thought that , in combination with the one from yesterday , you’d be able to see how that natural chalk can be used in several ways . I wrote to Rappard about natural chalk yesterday ,
  because I had to write to him anyway about things to do with lithography . And since I wanted to send him some croquis done with it , I used it to draw our in various poses . Well , I discovered that it’s also very suitable for croquis . One can also get half-tones in it by using breadcrumbs . Only the very deepest shadows are perhaps less easy to get , but then , certainly in many cases , one can use lithographic crayon — which is also warm .
I believe that you can already see from the figures that the studio is better now as regards the light . Isn’t everything outside beautiful at the moment , don’t you agree? I have many plans — you will understand that . You know that I’m busy with lots of different things . But I’d also like so much to learn different methods , because that’s a stimulus to work hard , and one gets more ideas as a result .
I wish I’d thought of this natural chalk before , because it’s preferable to many other things . It’s also not as hard as conté , that’s to say that it doesn’t scratch as much .
It’s not that I would like you to send me some more because I wouldn’t be able to work otherwise ; but I’ve written about it because I’d then be able to do many things with it in addition to the normal work .
Have I already written to you about those two large etchings by Israëls , a man lighting his pipe and an interior of a labourer’s dwelling? How beautiful they are . I think it mightily good of Israëls that he carries on etching , the more so since all the others , so to speak , have given it up , despite the enthusiasm with which the etching club was started at the time . At any rate , most haven’t made any progress in etching , and when they make one now it’s no better or more complete than what they made years ago . Yet old Israëls is still young enough to make progress despite his grey hairs , and huge progress at that — and I think that is true youth and evergreen energy .
By Jove , if the others had done the same , what beautiful Dutch etchings would have come into the world . I have 2 small etchings by Israëls , perhaps even his very first , a girl with a spade in a small garden and a woman with a basket on her back . Do you know them? I believe they were published by the Belgian etchers’ society .
So with that one piece of chalk I’ve already done 2 sketches and still have some left , and small croquis as well . In future I may use little else for ordinary work . Adieu , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
