Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter , thanks for the enclosure . I read your letter with great interest . I’m glad that you understand correctly from which quarter difficulties will probably come . Namely , that — without meaning to do so — women like S . (you rightly say that they , though , are good in themselves) aren’t very careful about what they say , etc . When , in short , you refer to a relationship between your and her own mother , that isn’t something on which I congratulate you . I fear that she’ll be drawn backwards many times by that link when you’re trying to bring about forward movement . But — it’s nothing unusual .
It is , however , a sad thought that something like the relationship between mother and daughter can have a dark side . So that a man who loves light and seeks it can be fatally thwarted by it . Through the influence of the mother and mixing with girlfriends — perhaps more than through anything else — something called a retrograde gets into women sometimes and prevents reforms in their thinking and actions , which are sometimes needed , and urgently needed . I’m glad that you rightly foresee what may lie in store for you from that quarter , but I’m not glad that you weren’t spared this — if the woman had left her family completely , you could expect fewer problems in the future , I believe .
  And the difficulty is precisely that it’s impossible to calculate exactly what form the problems will take , and that when taking precautionary measures one must sometimes think: yes , but it may well be that I’ll have to perform diametrically opposite manoeuvres .
Somewhere in a preface by Zola there are the following words , I believe in this form: ‘Yet these women are not bad , the impossibility of living a straight life in the midst of the gossip and calumny of the suburbs is the cause of their faults and their fall’ . If the is sufficiently cultivated to be able to follow you in thoughts and concepts and thus share in your inner life , that will be a strong bond that will neutralize many problems . The problem to be expected in establishing relations with her family , I would think , is that one sometimes lapses into the official as a result (people take it like that sometimes , most indiscreetly) , when one meant it to be more private and unofficial .
Act and be silent is not everyone’s aim , and some older and wiser family members lapse so easily into noise-making that one may regret having spoken to them . Especially because they can’t help intriguing , and anyway — they’re probably wolves .
 
I wish we weren’t so far apart . I wrote to you yesterday at greater length about some difficulties you may encounter shortly , but I was prevented from writing by the sense that I myself sometimes don’t know how to carry on . Moreover , I have faith that where love is true it doesn’t die , at least not when one acts with reason at the same time . Yet I would like to cross that out as well , because it’s not right . For love can indeed die , in a way — but there’s something like a power of renaissance in love .
What man kills God restores to life .
Van der Weele came to see me again . Perhaps through him I’ll make the acquaintance of Piet van der Velden , whom you certainly know from his figures of peasants and fishermen .
I met Van der V . once , and he made a good impression on me at the time . I was reminded of the character of Felix Holt the radical by Eliot . There’s something broad and rough in him that pleases me greatly — something like the roughness of torchon . A man who evidently doesn’t seek civilization in outward things but is much further inwardly , much much much further than most people . In short , he’s a true artist , and I’d like to get to know him for I would trust him and I’m sure I would learn from him . And if it doesn’t happen through Van der Weele , it isn’t impossible that I may bump into him at some point .
Rappard was due to visit me last Monday , then his fell ill , he wrote , and again he couldn’t come . Perhaps he’ll come this week .
Well , at present there are no drawings in which I don’t work in printer’s ink with a brush .
I have to say that I’m running a little short . This is certainly not your fault — but it’s not my fault either . Whatever calculations I make , I can’t economize any further .
  And to carry out some plans I would need to have more than I can command . I’d get stuck if I began them . But it’s sometimes a sad thing when one thinks , I could do one thing or another this way or that way , and to come up against the costs .
Then there remains undischarged energy in a person that one would prefer not to have to shut up inside oneself . Yet I don’t say this to complain — I’m grateful that I can make progress , albeit not as forcefully as I would like . But the English say sometimes: Time is money , and I can’t help thinking on occasion that it’s hard to see time passing in which this or that could have been done if I’d had the means . You will understand what I mean , I would like to be able to spend more , both on models and on painting materials . Even if I don’t sell a single one of my studies , I still believe they’re worth what they cost in outgoings . The studio is so much better and more practical , but I only have enough steam for ‘half speed’ and want to go ‘full speed’ . Again , I don’t say this to complain , nor because I want to press you to make greater sacrifices — you’re already overburdened yourself . But in explanation and to open my heart for once . For you’ll understand that sometimes I’m burdened with cares . Still , we must make shift with what we have , and undermine with patience the things we can’t lift with strength . This week I drew a few recumbent figures , I’ll need figures of corpses or sick people eventually , both men and women . I passed by Israëls’s house lately — I’ve never been inside it — the front door stood open because the hall was being scrubbed — I saw things hanging in the hall and do you know what they were?
The large Herkomer , Last muster Sunday at Chelsea and a photo after that painting by Roll , Miners’ strike , which you may remember I wrote to you about at the time . I didn’t know there was a photo of Last muster . I have the large woodcut of the two main figures and the first rough sketch , done long before the painting .
Well , adieu old chap , best wishes for your patient , good fortune with work .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
