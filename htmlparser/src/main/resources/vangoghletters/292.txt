Letter|My dear Theo ,
I often get around to writing to you on Sundays , and likewise today . I’ve been reading Le Nabab by Daudet these past few days , and find it masterly — among other things that walk taken by the Nabab and Hemerlingue the banker at Père Lachaise in the twilight while the bust of Balzac , a dark silhouette against the sky , looks down on them ironically . It’s just like a drawing by Daumier . You wrote to me about Daumier saying that he’d made The Revolution — Denis Dussoubs . When you wrote that , I didn’t know who Denis Dussoubs was ; now I’ve read it in Histoire d’un crime by Victor Hugo . He’s a noble character — I wish I knew the drawing by D .
Of course I can’t read a book about Paris without instantly thinking of you . I also can’t read a book about Paris without to some extent also finding The Hague in it , which is admittedly smaller than Paris but still a court city with corresponding morals .
When you say in your last letter ‘what a riddle there is in nature’ , I echo your words . Life in the abstract is already a riddle , reality turns it into a riddle within a riddle .
And who are we to solve it? All the same , we ourselves form a particle of it , of the society of which we ask , Where is it going , to the devil or to God?
Yet the sun rises , says V . Hugo .
Long , long ago , in L’ami Fritz by Erckmann-Chatrian , I read a remark by the old rabbi that has often come to mind since: ‘We are not alive in order to be happy , but we must try to deserve happiness . ’ Taken in isolation , this thought seems a little pedantic , at least one could interpret it as a little pedantic , but in the context in which the remark occurred , namely on the lips of the sympathetic figure of old Rabbi David Sechel , it struck me deeply and I often think of it . Also when drawing — one shouldn’t count on selling one’s drawings , but one has a duty to make them such that they have value and are serious . For one may not become nonchalant or indifferent , even if one is disappointed by one’s circumstances .
 
As for my plan with the lithographs , I’ve thought about it a lot ; if that had been all , I fear I wouldn’t have made any progress , for what is there to think about?
Thus in addition I’ve again made a few drawings for them , a woman with a sack of coal on her head with a yard in the background , a silhouette of roofs and chimneys , and a woman at the wash-tub .
You needn’t worry that I’ll undertake anything else for the time being apart from the drawings themselves — I must wait a little before doing trials with lithography until I have some money to get on with them . But I believe it could come to something .
From time to time I have a great longing to be in London again . I’d so very much like to know more about printing and drawing on wood .
I feel a power in me that I must develop , a fire that I may not put out but must fan , although I don’t know to what outcome it will lead me , and wouldn’t be surprised if it was a sombre one .
In times like these , what should one wish for? What is the happiest lot in these circumstances?
In some situations it’s better to be the vanquished than the victor , for example , better Prometheus than Jupiter . Anyway , it’s an old saying , ‘what will be will be’ .
To change the subject , do you know whose work has made a deep impression on me? I saw reproductions of Julien Dupré (is this a son of Jules Dupré???) . One was of two reapers , the other , a splendid large woodcut from Monde illustré , of a peasant woman taking a cow into the meadow . It seemed to me outstanding , very energetic and very true to life . It perhaps resembles Pierre Billet , say , or Butin .
 
Then I also saw various figures by Dagnan-Bouveret , a beggar , a wedding party , The accident , The Garden of the Tuileries . Those two seem to me to be fellows who wrestle physically with nature , fellows who don’t weaken and aren’t afraid of dirtying their hands . You wrote to me about ‘The accident’ at the time , now I know it and find it very beautiful .
They perhaps don’t have the lofty quality , the almost religious emotion of Millet , at least not to the same degree as Millet himself ; they perhaps don’t have his full , warm love , but even so how outstandingly good it is . Now admittedly I only know reproductions , but it seems to me that they can’t contain anything that wasn’t put into the original work itself .
By the way , it took a long time before I found Thomas Faed’s work beautiful , but these days I don’t hesitate about it any more , for instance , the Sunday in the backwoods of Canada — Home and the homeless — Worn out — The poor , the poor man’s friend , anyway , you know the series of aquatints published by Graves .
Today I worked on old drawings from Etten , because I saw the pollard willows again in a similar leafless state here in the field , and what I had seen last year came to mind again .
Sometimes I long so much to do landscape , just as one would for a long walk to refresh oneself , and in all of nature , in trees for instance , I see expression and a soul , as it were . A row of pollard willows sometimes resembles a procession of orphan men .
Young corn can have something ineffably pure and gentle about it that evokes an emotion like that aroused by the expression of a sleeping child , for example .
 
The grass trodden down at the side of a road looks tired and dusty like the inhabitants of a poor quarter . After it had snowed recently I saw a group of Savoy cabbages that were freezing , and that reminded me of a group of women I had seen early in the morning at a water and fire cellar in their thin skirts and old shawls .
As for those figures that I wanted to lithograph , I think the most difficult thing is to find thirty or so that together will form some sort of whole — for that one has to draw considerably more than 30 . If I first have them , reproduction will be a second step which may then be easier than if one had started reproducing before one had the whole . Perhaps , or rather certainly , you’ll have been here again before I’ve got as far as having them done , and then we can discuss this further .
Something similar for primary schools has already been made here , namely 24 lithographs by Schmidt Crans which I saw recently . A few of them are good , but you’ll understand , given the person who made them , that as a whole they’re rather faint-hearted . All the same , it seems that schools are keen to use them — but how deplorable it is that people are satisfied with something like that , especially for schools . Well , it’s the same with this as with everything else .
Still , old chap , read Le Nabab above all . It’s splendid . One could call that character the good scoundrel . Are there such people? I’m sure there are . There’s a lot of heart in those books by Daudet . For example , in Les rois en exil the character of the queen ‘with eyes of aquamarine’ . Write again soon .
How much good it does a person if one is in a gloomy mood to walk on the empty beach and look into the grey-green sea with the long white lines of the waves . Yet if one has a need for something great , something infinite , something in which one can see God , one needn’t look far . I thought I saw something — deeper , more infinite , more eternal than an ocean — in the expression in the eyes of a baby — when it wakes in the morning and crows — or laughs because it sees the sun shine into its cradle . If there is a ‘ray from on high’ , it might be found there .
Adieu , old chap , with a handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
