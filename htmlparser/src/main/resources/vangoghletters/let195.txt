Letter|The Hague , 30 Dec . 1881 .
My dear Rappard ,
I received your letter from Brussels .
I don’t like it at all , but still , you wrote it at a time when , as you yourself say , you weren’t quite normal . Nothing or next to nothing in your letter holds water .
I’m glad you’re back from Brussels . Still , you don’t belong there in my opinion , and as regards the ‘technical competence’ you hope to gain at the Academy , you will , I fear , end up being deceived . Even that can’t be learned from people like Stallaert .
But now I’m busy with all kinds of work , for I’ve rented a small studio here and will be moving into it around 1 January and still have a lot of things to see to .
Later , when things have quietened down a bit , I’ll write to you again calmly about this and that , but don’t take offence if I’ve got more serious things to do now than write letters .
Of course my letters don’t pretend always to hit the mark , always to explain things precisely , oh no , I’m often wrong about things . But if I tell you ,
  Rappard , those academics you worry about aren’t worth tuppence , and I’m referring to Stallaert and Severdonck &amp ; c . , I mean it with all my heart , and I’m telling you , if I were you I’d forget about them . But I’ve already told you this a couple of times , I won’t say it again , I don’t want to hear another syllable or utter another syllable about the whole academy ever again . It isn’t worth the bother .
And I hereby send you my regards – what kind of people are they , those artists with whom you drank Lambiek? Why don’t you mention even a couple of them by name? Are they people who’ll be of any use to you? I hope so , for your sake , but I seriously doubt it .
Good-day , old chap , I have no more time , nor any desire , to write more . When you’re in your studio , work often with a model , you’ll get more satisfaction from it in the long run . Anyway – good-day .
Vincent
 
Should you want to write to me again , send your letters to Etten . They’ll send them on – I’m wavering between 2 or 3 studios and will decide which one to take before 1 January , but at the moment I don’t have a fixed address , you’ll learn of it at some point . I left Etten because I was having too much trouble with my about all sorts of things that actually aren’t worth talking about – about going to church &amp ; c . &amp ; c . , and even if I worked hard and a great deal , it put me in a state of weariness and coldness that’s not good for anything . So I’ve settled down here and am glad to be in different surroundings . I have a few worries , but that’s better than all that quarrelling and nagging .
