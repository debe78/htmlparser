Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Here are some of the poems by Coppée that I promised to send you . Tristement reminds me of a poplar avenue by Hippolyte Boulenger — the Vallée de Josaphat , I think . What an autumnal mood it conveys .
I thought that you’d like them too .
There’s much , much more in the little volume ; I just took things from it here and there .
Have painted a few studies outdoors these last few days , I’m sending you a croquis of one of them .
My continues to do well — the fracture has set and the plaster is off . All the same , she’ll still have to keep the leg horizontal for another 6 weeks or so . Yesterday , though , we carried her into the living room on a sort of stretcher , and later on she can be taken out into the open air now and again in the same way .
With these poems by Coppée I’m adding an Arabian fable that I found this week in a piece by Lesseps , Voyage dans le Soudan . I liked the idea , and I believe it can be thus . Viewed thus , men don’t play a very noble role — well , but that is in fact the case . It doesn’t apply in general , though , because . . . . . . . . does the candle burn for the sake of the moth? If one knew that — well then — it might well be worthwhile committing suicide that way .
 
If , though , the candle itself were to snigger at the burned wings — — — — .
But however that may be , it struck me . And — I always believe that in the depths there are these things — that would rend our hearts if we knew them . There are moments when one is wholly disenchanted with people — one’s own self included , of course — yet — chiefly because one will perish soon enough , after all , it really isn’t worthwhile persisting in one’s displeasure , even if it were well-founded .
And should our ideas about the worthlessness of humanity be unfounded , our mistake is all the worse for ourselves . In my view , the worst evil of all evils is self-righteousness , and eradicating it in oneself a never-ending weeding job .
All the more difficult for us Dutchmen , because so often our upbringing itself must inevitably make us become self-righteous to a very high degree . But not to harp on about it .
I say to you once more that my idea about the drawings and that I ask you , show them if you get the opportunity , is based on things that aren’t really my fault — I’m quite often reproached ‘that I don’t sell’ . Quite often asked: why others do sell and I don’t . I reply that I do hope to sell in time , but believe that I can most directly influence this by working on steadily , and that at the moment any ‘working at it’ to sell my current work would yield little . Consequently that it’s a question that doesn’t really interest me one way or the other , my attention being on making progress . All the same , both because people sometimes reproach me about it , and because I’m sometimes hard-pressed by difficulties in getting by , I may not neglect anything that is even the slightest chance to sell something . But again , it goes without saying that I’m prepared for its not yielding anything immediately . For my part , though , it’s something that stimulates me to show my work to a few people , now that I’ve finally made a start on it (perhaps that’s very odd of me) . Regards , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
Sadly
Obsessed by these words , widowhood and autumn ,
My reverie seeks no other to express
This melancholy , vast and monotonous ,
That robs me of all hope and all desire to love .
Ceaselessly it evokes a long , long avenue
Of plane trees , immensely tall , half bare ,
In which a woman in deep mourning , veiled ,
Moves slowly forward on the pallid grass .
Her long skirts leave behind a wake ,
Trailing and rustling in the fallen leaves ;
She follows with her gaze the passage of a cloud
Before the wind , driving from the north , already cold .
She thinks of him , now absent , who was wont to say: I love you!
And under the wide low sky from which the light has gone ,
Sees that , with the last chrysanthemum , yesterday
The last butterfly has also died .
And so she walks across the faded grass ,
Weary of wishing , weary of submitting ,
And always in her path , the plane-tree leaves
Fall with a sound as sad as sighs .
— In vain — to chase away these gloomy images
Do I call up my youth , and that splendid summer .
I do not trust the sun , no more believe the roses ,
And go about , head lowered , like a haunted man .
My heart’s so full of autumn and of widowhood
That I forever dream , under a pure , clear sky —
Of one in mourning — in a chill landscape ,
And the leaves falling at first winter’s wind .
 
To a Second lieutenant
You carry , my handsome officer ,
With perfect grace ,
Your sword with hilt of steel ,
But I think of our defeat .
This pelisse of finest stuff
Sets off your figure perfectly ;
You’re charming ; but after all
We lost the battle .
We read your intrepidity
In your black eyes under their slender brows .
Nothing wrong with wearing fancy gloves —
But , they took two provinces from us .
At your age one’s always proud
Of a little bit of braid ;
But — do you see — ’twas yesterday
They maimed our motherland .
Lieutenant , I do not know
If of an evening , a finger to your brow ,
Holding book and compasses ,
You stay up late , beside the lamp .
Are your men your children?
Are you their leader and their father?
I wish to believe that , and would fight off
A doubt that fills me with despair .
Stripes on your sleeve , on your way ,
Is it of deliverance you think?
— Young man , give me your hand ,
Let’s give a little shout — ‘Vive la France!’
Arabian tale
A moth was in love with a candle . Ever drawn towards it , it would come close to it . But as soon as the tip of its wing received a slight blow it would retreat , throwing itself at the cruel one’s feet and filling the air with its cries and groans . In the meantime the candle burned down — before giving out its last burst of light , it said to its suitor:
Moth — you have made a great deal of noise over a few blows to the tips of your wings , you have unjustly reproached me ; I have loved you in silence ; my flame is about to go out . I am dying — farewell — fly off to other loves .
 
The lost dog
When we go home , at night , through empty city streets ,
And see upon the wet , green , greasy mud
Long streaks of gaslight , more of them every day ,
Often a stray dog with matted coat , a dreadful , doleful sight ,
An old dog from hereabouts , which its master , penniless ,
Has thrown out with a kick — perhaps mourning it —
Will stick its stubborn nose into your heels ,
And if you should turn back , give you a look ,
And what a look — long , fearful , all cajolery ,
A mistress’s , a poor man’s touching gaze ,
Yet hopeless , with that uncertain air belonging to
A woman scorned and a poor man who feels his shame .
And if you stop , he’ll stop with you , and
Feebly wag his wet and drooping tail ,
Timid , knowing his fate lies in your hands .
He seems to say: ‘Come on — take me with you — please?’
We’re moved — and yet we don’t quite dare ;
We’re poor ourselves — and rabies is a fearful thing .
And then — unkindly — making as if to raise
Our stick — we tell the dog: ‘Go on , be off with you!’
And — all contrite — he goes to plead his cause elsewhere .
Ill-omened meeting — and what times are these ,
These savage Prussians , what they have done to us ,
(or , failing Prussians , drunken sots)
That the poorest folk now cast their dogs aside ,
And when , distracted from the public show of grief , we must yet
Pity these animals — who turn upon us their imploring gaze .
At the ambulance
Disturbing the convent’s silence ,
With its urgent noise
Arrives an ambulance .
They’re bringing in a wounded soldier .
Blood glistening on his army coat ,
He limps , shattered by a shell ,
Using his rifle as a crutch
To climb down from the wagon .
It’s an old man with great moustaches ,
Three stripes upon his sleeve ,
Who hates hypocrites and prudes
And starts by letting out an oath .
He makes improper overtures ,
His way of looking’s almost insulting ,
Bringing a blush , under their horned headdresses ,
To the cheeks of 18-year-old novices .
If the Sister , thinking he’s asleep and she’s alone ,
Prays by his bed ,
Quickly he’ll fill his old clay pipe
And whistle with an air of boredom .
What’s it to him if constantly
They watch and pray for him?
He knows his leg is lost
And that they’re going to hack it off .
He’s wild with rage — Leave him alone ;
We’re very patient here ;
And there’s an atmosphere
That consoles , and masters , too .
The influence is slow — but sure ,
Of these obedient servants of their vows ,
Gentle when they dress his wound
And gentle , talking of God .
— So — feeling , in his own way ,
That subtle , pious charm ,
The veteran , to every prayer ,
Soon will say: Thy will be done!
 
The novice
When all her pain , all her regrets had died ,
And she had lost her last deceiving hope ,
Resigned , she went to seek in convent walls
The calm that’s prologue to eternal life .
Rosary swinging at her flannel skirts ,
And pale — often would she come and walk
Here in the garden , sheltered from the wind ,
Where no flower bloomed , all cabbage-beds and overhanging vines .
Yet one day , in that garden did she pluck
A flower whose scent exhaled a worldly memory ,
Which grew there despite submission’s vows .
She breathed it in at length , then — as evening fell ,
In sanctity , her conscience now at rest ,
She died , the way an incense-burner gives up life .
Evermore
Divine hope that two together come to form
And two together share ,
The hope to love long , love always — love
More dearly every day ;
Desire eternal , touching and chimerical ,
That lovers sigh ,
When , blissful moment , searching each other out ,
Their lips exchange a mutual breath .
That vain , illusory desire — that cheating hope ,
Whereof we never spoke ;
It pains me to see we are afraid of it ,
Though it be in our soul .
And when to your questioning , I , your sweetheart
Murmur a soft response ,
’Tis the word: — Evermore! — that’s on my lips
Without my uttering it .
And though its dear echo sounds within your heart ,
Your silence is the same
When on your breast , languorous unto death ,
I swear I love you .
What signifies the past — what of time to come?
For what is best of all —
Is to believe that it should never end ,
That hour’s illusion .
And when I tell you — evermore — do naught
That might dispel that dream ,
And may your kiss on mine
Press all the longer and more tenderly .
 
Desire in melancholy
Everything lives — everything loves , and I , sad and alone ,
Stand like a dead tree against the vernal sky
I can no longer love , I who have lived but thirty years ,
And have my mistress lately quit without regrets .
I am like a sick man , his thoughts grown dull
And wearying of his stale , familiar room ,
His sole amusement , stupid and mechanical ,
To count inside his head his carpet’s flowers .
Sometimes I wish my end were near ,
And all these recollections , once so sweet ,
I thrust away — as from the portrait of an ancestor
Whose gaze disturbs us , we turn away our eye .
Even of that old love , that drew so many tears ,
No trace remains in this , my jaded heart .
No more than on the rose the butterfly
That brushed against it leaves a trace .
O , thou figure in my thoughts , veiled and dim ,
Whom I may meet tomorrow , whom I know not yet ,
A courtesan , leaning at table ’mid the remnants of a meal ,
Or — a young woman , pensive , eyes downcast and pale .
Oh — appear! — if yet this wretched heart , empty of desire ,
Its flame extinct , you can again ignite ,
Give me again the infinite within a woman’s glance
And all of nature blooming in a kiss .
Come! As sailors on a foundering ship
Throw — to win an hour’s respite — a treasure to the deep —
Come! — I promise you all — heart and soul , blood and flesh ,
All — for but a moment’s faith — or yet of drunken rapture .
Sorrow assuaged
You whom I saw as like the blasted oak ,
I find you now a father , find you spouse ;
And yet to that brow that dreamed of death’s release ,
A pistol once was held .
All that you cannot have forgotten quite ;
You knew how one suffers and despairs ;
You carried in your breast the viper vile
Of a great love betrayed , a great hope — crushed .
Oblivion eluded you — you sought out
Tumults , orgy and its songs — fame and its jibes
And the long roaring of the sea and of the wind —
Who , then , unto your sorrow put a silent stop
O Lonesome one — ’twas but the rhythmic beat
Marked by the cradle of a little child .
 
A wound reopened
O , my heart , are you then so craven and so weak?
And would you be like a convict , dragging his ball and chain ,
Who , though released , yet hobbles still?
Be silent — well you know the sentence she has passed on you .
I will no longer suffer , and thus I order you:
If I should feel you swell once more and writhe ,
May I , with a stifled sob , crush you ,
And no one shall know of it , and , to still my cries ,
They’d see me — for that ghastly minute ,
Clench my teeth — just like a soldier during amputation .
The first one
It’s not that she was so beautiful ,
But we were both twenty ,
And that day , as I recall ,
Was a spring morning .
It’s not that she looked so serious ,
But here and now I swear
That never have I dared do a more courageous thing
Than when I told her that I loved her .
It’s not that she had a tender heart ,
But it was so delightful
To talk to her , to listen to her speak ,
My eyes would fill with tears .
It’s not that her soul was hard ,
But all the same , we parted .
From then my sadness takes its date ,
And will continue , everlastingly .
In the street — evening
Nine o’clock . Drums sound the retreat ,
Flighty grisettes are quitting working streets
After their daily stint is done .
It’s like a kick delivered to a swarming hive .
In waterproofs , with little leather bags ,
You see them fly , trotting from every side
To families and secret love affairs .
Skilled laundresses — stitchers of ankle-boots ,
Daughters of Montparnasse and Ménilmontant ,
Happy he who waits for you , if his heart still beats .
