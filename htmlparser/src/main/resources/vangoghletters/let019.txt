Letter|London, 20 February 1874
My dear Theo,
Thanks for your letter. I don’t need the book yet, but send it back anyway when you’ve had time to read it. I haven’t read the book by Van Vloten, but I’d like to have it sometime. I’ve read another book on art by V. Vl. and didn’t agree with him completely, and it was really quite scholarly. Bürger is simpler, and everything he says is true. I’m glad you went to Amsterdam; thank Uncle Cor when you see him for the brochure he sent me.
I’m glad you’re so happy at Rooses’; as I already asked Anna Carbentus to tell you, you’re completely right about pulling the carrot. I also agree with you about B.H., but beware of your heart, old chap.
Have you seen Mr Jacobson’ collection yet? It’s well worth while, he’ll no doubt ask you to come and see it sometime. Give him my regards, as politely as you can, and tell him that I’m doing well here and am seeing a lot of beautiful things.
 
I’m all right, I’m busy. Thank Willem for his letter and give my regards to everyone at Rooses’ and Iterson, Jan and Piet, and anyone who asks after me. I wish you well.
Vincent
