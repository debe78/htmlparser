My dear friend Rappard
This is to thank you for your last letter , which I would certainly have done earlier were it not for the fact I’ve not been my normal self for some time . I must tell you your letter reached me not at my studio but in the hospital , where I’ve been for 3 weeks now . So your letter was doubly welcome at the time , and what you say about the drawings that seem not to have pleased my worthy Uncle gave me double pleasure . Later , however , I heard from someone else that they weren’t so bad and that he hadn’t meant to be so critical . Whatever the case , while I was making those drawings and some more since , of the same sort of fish-drying barns in the dunes for instance , I caught a cold and then had fever and nerves as well , and it seems that one thing and another affected the bladder so that I couldn’t urinate , and in the end I was so anxious and in such pain that I came here . And they rummaged around in my bladder with a catheter and so forth , and now I’m beginning to return to a more normal condition , which pleases me a good deal . But I’m not clear of it yet , and still don’t know whether I’ll be able to go home soon . I hope it will be over within a week , but it will take some time in any event .
 
It’s very pleasant here in the hospital . I’m in a ward with 10 beds , but until today I was unable to draw because I had to lie still , and and even now I’ve made only a very faint and weak beginning and can’t pursue anything or go deeper into things . But I’m allowed in the garden for an hour a day , and there I began scrawling again yesterday . And at least I’m starting to look again , whereas at first I was too miserable even to see .
I’ll have to take things very quietly for a while when I leave here . Oh well .
I must say a particular word in praise of the treatment here . If I’m ever taken ill again , I shan’t hesitate for a moment , any more than I do now , before going to the hospital . It’s far more practical , in my view , than lying ill at home , at least in circumstances like mine . I feel as if I’m now almost completely cured , but the problem is that as a result of too much moving and walking &amp ; c . I may have a relapse at any moment , which is what happened to me last week ; otherwise I would now be well on the way .
 
As soon as I have a few drawings again in a little while , of the fish-drying barns or a courtyard , for instance , I would dearly like to send you something to see if you can place it . But I shan’t be in a hurry , and shall wait until I have one better than average , because I would rather send it to you than to Amsterdam again . Although I do hope Amsterdam will turn out all right again .
And we must agree that if you’re unable to place it you mustn’t hesitate to send it back , and mustn’t think I’ll be discouraged , because it won’t work straightaway . So whether it’s the fault of my drawing or the fault of the possible buyer , let the two of us agree that we shan’t immediately let ourselves be frightened off by the failure of the experiment (were it not to succeed) . When I’m back at work , I’ll write again soon . Thanks again for your letter — I didn’t want to put off replying to it any longer . Meanwhile believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
