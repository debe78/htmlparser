Letter|I give you leave to say what you like to Mauve about the contents of this letter , but it doesn’t have to go any further .
My dear Theo ,
Today I met Mauve and had a very regrettable conversation with him which made it clear to me that Mauve and I have parted ways for ever . Mauve has gone so far that he can’t retract it , or at least certainly wouldn’t want to . I asked him to come and see my work and talk things over afterwards . Mauve refused outright , ‘I certainly won’t come to see you , it’s over and done with’ .
In the end he said , ‘you have a vicious character’ . At that point I turned around – it was in the dunes – and walked home alone .
Mauve blames me for saying , I’m an artist – which I won’t take back , because those words naturally imply always seeking without ever fully finding . It’s the exact opposite of saying , ‘I know it already , I’ve already found it’ .
  To the best of my knowledge , those words mean ‘I seek , I pursue , my heart is in it’ . I do have ears , Theo – if someone says ‘you have a vicious character’ , what should I do? I turned around and went back alone , but with great sorrow in my heart because Mauve dared to say that to me . I won’t ask him to explain such a thing to me , nor will I apologize .
And yet – and yet – and yet . I wish that Mauve regretted it . People suspect me of something . . . it’s in the air . . . I must be hiding something . . . Vincent is keeping something back that may not be divulged . . Well , gentlemen , I’ll tell you – you who set great store by manners and culture , and rightly so , provided it’s the real thing – what is more cultured , more sensitive , more manly: to forsake a woman or to take on a forsaken one?
 
This winter I met a woman , abandoned by the man whose child she was carrying .
A pregnant woman who roamed the streets in winter – who had to earn her bread , you can imagine how .
I took that woman as a model and worked with her the whole winter . I couldn’t give her a model’s full daily wage , but all the same , I paid her rent and have until now been able , thank God , to preserve her and her from hunger and cold by sharing my own bread with her . When I met this woman , she caught my eye because she looked ill .
I made her take baths and as much fortifying remedies as I could afford , she’s become much healthier . I went with her to Leiden , where there’s a maternity hospital she’ll go to for her confinement . No wonder she was ill , the was the wrong way round and she had to have an operation , which entailed turning the child with forceps . Still , there’s a good chance that she’ll come through it all right . She’ll have the baby in June .
It seems to me that any man worth the leather his shoes are made of would have done the same in such circumstances .
  I find what I did so simple and natural that I thought I could keep it to myself . She found posing difficult , but she learned it anyway . I’ve progressed with my drawing by having a good model . This woman is now attached to me like a tame dove – for my part , I can marry only once , and when would be a better time to do it than with her , because only by doing so can I continue to help her , and otherwise hardship will make her take the same road that ends in the abyss . She has no money , but she helps me to earn money in my work . I’m full of enthusiasm and ambition for my profession and work , if I left off painting and making watercolours for a while , it’s because I was so shaken by Mauve’s forsaking me , and if he really were to reconsider , I’d begin again with courage . As it is , I can’t even look at a brush , it makes me nervous .
I wrote: Theo , can you enlighten me as to Mauve’s attitude – perhaps this letter will enlighten you . You’re my brother , it’s natural that I speak to you about private matters , but someone who says to me , you have a vicious character , I stop speaking to him from that very moment .
I couldn’t do otherwise , I did what the hand found to do , I worked . I thought I would be understood without words . I was in fact thinking of another woman for whom my heart beats – but she was far away and didn’t want to see me , and this one – there she was , ill , pregnant , hungry – in the winter . I couldn’t do otherwise . Mauve , Theo , Tersteeg , you all have my livelihood in your hands , will you leave me penniless or turn your backs on me – now I’ve spoken and shall wait to hear what's said to me .
Vincent
 
I’m sending you a couple of studies , because perhaps you’ll see from them that she helps me greatly by posing .
My drawings are ‘by my model and me’ .
The one with the white cap is her .
Considering , however , that in a year , when I’ll probably be working very differently , I’ll have to base myself on the studies I’m making now as conscientiously as I possibly can , I’d like to have these three back in any case . You see that they’ve been made with care . If I later have an interior or a waiting room or some such thing , these will be of use to me because I’ll have to consult them for the details .
But I thought it might be good for you to know how I spend my time . These studies demand a rather dry technique , if I’d concentrated here on the effect they’d be less useful to me later on .
But I think you’ll understand this yourself . The paper I’d actually like to have most is the kind on which the female figure is drawn bending forwards , but if possible of the colour of unbleached linen . I have no more of it in that thickness , I believe one calls it double Ingres . I can’t get any more of it here . When you see how that drawing is done , you’ll understand that the thin kind can barely take it . I wanted to include a small figure in black merino , but I can’t roll it . The chair by the large figure isn’t finished because I’d like to put an old oak chair there .
