Paris , January 1876
My dear Theo ,
In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find various packages ; be so good as to take care of them .
First of all , one for you containing ‘Felix Holt’ , when you’ve read it please send it to Etten , and when they’ve finished it there please send it back here , when you get the chance , because it doesn’t belong to me . It’s a book that touched me deeply , and it will no doubt have the same effect on you .
There’s also a package for Mr Tersteeg and one for Mrs Tersteeg , and also one for Mauve and his wife . I wrote and told Mauve that he should ask you for that book about Michel ; please show it to him sometime when it suits you .
 
There’s also a package for Pa ; do your best to ensure that it arrives in Etten on Pa’s birthday . Perhaps you could add Felix Holt to it and read it after it’s been in Etten , that might be the best thing .
In the small roll addressed to you you’ll find 3 etchings after Jules Dupré , one for you , one for Uncle Jan van Gogh , with my regards , and one for Pa . Also for Pa a lithograph after Bodmer and an etching by Jacque , and then there’s a lithograph after Cabat for you . Cabat is a lot like Ruisdael , there are two magnificent paintings by him in the Luxembourg , one a pond with trees around it in the autumn at sunset , and the other the evening of a grey autumn day , a road by the waterside and a couple of large oak trees .
That etching after Jules Dupré is beautiful , it’s one from an album of 6 with Dupré’s portrait . He has such a simple and noble face , it reminds me a bit of Mauve’s , though he’s older , and perhaps in reality he looks different from Mauve .
 
It’s good that you’re taking English lessons , you won’t regret it .
I’d like to send you a Longfellow and ‘Andersen’s fairy tales’ , I’ll see if I can find them . If I do send them , read especially Longfellow’s Evangeline , Miles Standish , The baron of St Castine and King Robert of Sicily &amp ; c .
And now I’ll bid you good-day again and shake your hand in thought . Regards to everyone at Rooses’ and if anyone else should ask after me , and believe me ever
Your loving brother
Vincent .
Give my regards again to my friend Borchers .
