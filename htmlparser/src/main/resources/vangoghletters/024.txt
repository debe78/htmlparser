Letter|Dearest Betsy ,
I had wanted to fill this little book with drawings for you , but Theo is leaving today , so I don’t have any more time . You’ll just have to have it the way it is , and when I come back next year I’ll make a new one . Next Monday I’m going back to London with my sister Anna , to the house I’ve drawn for you , and then I’ll be travelling on the little steamboat that I’ve
  drawn here . Well , Betsy , adieu , until next year .
Vincent
