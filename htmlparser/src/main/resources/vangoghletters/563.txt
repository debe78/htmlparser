Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m really looking forward to hearing from you . For the time when I have to decide has come .
We only have about 10 days until the end of the month , and I do need to know what’s what .
But anyway , for my part I’ve decided — only it would be pleasant for me if you could see it the same way as I do .
If you agree that the plan of coming to Paris should go ahead as soon as possible — in other words after I’ve been in Brabant for a short while — then I’ll send you from here the studies and drawings I have here .
I wanted to get on with that , though . Because otherwise I’ll have to be here for even longer .
I’d also so very much like to get the work on my teeth finished .
What should I do?
Altogether I’ve got one franc fifty left — and as for food , I’ve still got five francs credit until the end of the month . It’s desirable for so many reasons that we take the step of changing quickly .
You understand that I can’t afford to take painting materials with me from here to Brabant — so I’ll probably be in a double fix there , both for models and for paint . So there’s no choice — for that matter what need is there for a choice , for what’s most pressing has to be done first , and that’s this period of drawing nudes and plaster casts .
 
I write to you rather curtly , perhaps , but it may not be put off .
For the rest , it actually goes without saying that there can’t be a single objection to finding a temporary garret in Paris right away , on the very first day I arrive — and then I can go to the Louvre or L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts for that drawing , and that way it’ll be all the more successful at Cormon’s . So let’s not delay or get involved in long-winded discussions .
We have to put our backs into it ; well then , we’ll do that .
If we ever want to do anything good , depend upon it that it will increasingly come down to decisiveness and to quite swift action and that , while despite all the effort one might put in , no one can know with certainty the results of his enterprises in advance , some courage and promptness of action can do no harm .
If it were in any way possible , I’d like to have the second half of that work on my teeth done this month . I’d like to pack up my studies and send them to you , and leave on the last day of this month or even a few days earlier .
But not stay on into March , on account of the rent .
Would there be a possibility of that?
  Then I can help with the packing at home if it could be of any use to them .
And if I could do a little painting or drawing there , so much the better .
But — the sooner and more energetically we get through that period of drawing in Paris , the better for the whole future . Even what I’ve done in these few weeks here has helped , I feel . And if I didn’t do it , then I would , even though I found it in a different way in nature itself , then I’d always have trouble with fellows who had been at some academy or other — that I couldn’t draw — according to them . I still don’t know how things will turn out for me in the end at the academy here — I wrote and told you recently , didn’t I , about how they’d deliberately picked a quarrel with me .
I heard yesterday that Siberdt — the teacher — had said somewhere that I had a good understanding of drawing and that he’d been rather too hasty . Since he doesn’t come into the class all that often , I haven’t seen him in several days .
I’m working on a female torso at the moment . Regards — but write as soon as you can . My constitution is more or less the same , but still I think it’s beginning to improve . With a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
If I didn’t do it — go to Paris , that is — then I wouldn’t get any better — for I have to do something about earning more . I’m doing myself no good at all now — if nothing had to be taken off , one could live perfectly well on 150 francs , but there’s always too much to come off . But still , my health is improving — and it will come right .
