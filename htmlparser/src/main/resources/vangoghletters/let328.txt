Dear Mr de Zwart ,
Last Monday I paid Giesenberg not only the 4 . 60 guilders due that day but also a further 10 guilders .
In accordance with the matter dealt with in my letter of last month with regard to the attic room .
May I now count on your kind consideration in respect of fitting it up efficiently?
Otherwise leaving it to you , naturally , to decide how you want to do it .
I respectfully remain ,
Your servant
Vincent van Gogh .
