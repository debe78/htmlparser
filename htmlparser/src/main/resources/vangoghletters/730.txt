Letter|My dear friend Gauguin
I’m taking advantage of my first trip out of the hospital to write you a few most sincere and profound words of friendship .
I have thought of you a great deal in the hospital , and even in the midst of fever and relative weakness .
Tell me . Was my brother Theo’s journey really necessary – my friend? Now at least reassure him completely , and yourself , please . Trust that in fact no evil exists in this best of worlds , where everything is always for the best .
 
So I want you to give my warm regards to good Schuffenecker –
to refrain from saying bad things about our poor little yellow house until more mature reflection on either side –
to give my regards to the painters I saw in Paris .
I wish you prosperity in Paris . With a good handshake
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Roulin has been really kind to me , it was he who had the presence of mind to get me out of there before the others were convinced .
Please reply .
