Letter|My dear Theo ,
Today I sent you 1 drawing of Kitchen gardens in Laan van Meerdervoort .
So now you have a figure of mine and a landscape . And I think you’ll see that I’m not staying at the same level .
Even though this is ‘only white and black’ and unsaleable??? and disagreeable??? I still hope that there may be something strong in it . And I think that , far from holding it against me for devoting myself specifically to drawing things , one can see it as definite proof that I’m taking the most practical path . Considering that one can more easily go from drawing to painting than the other way round: making paintings without drawing the necessary studies .
It goes without saying that it gives me great displeasure and doesn’t make my life any easier when those whose sympathy I more or less thought I could count on , such as Mauve and H . G . T . , become indifferent or hostile and hateful . I haven’t heard anything from Mauve , sometimes he’s ill , at other times he needs to rest or is too busy . How beautiful his painting for the Salon was .
  But you understand these things yourself , so enough of this .
This little drawing also needs a small grey mount .
You write that you’ve moved house . I’ll do my best to make something now and then for the walls of your new home .
I may also have a few nice woodcuts , if you’d like them , since I have duplicates of several nice things . But you must look at them when you come this summer .
Though I haven’t moved , I’ve nevertheless made a change in my house by having a bedroom partitioned off in the attic , so I now have more room in my studio , the more so because the stove is gone .
Drawing , you see , involves all kinds of things that many would prefer to disregard .
  There’s the true perspective of an interior , for example (sometime I’ll send you one of those as well) , there are the broad outlines of a landscape , and as for me , I see no chance of success without studying the nude . All of that is essentially drawing , much is clarified when one has mastered that to some extent , and I , for my part , go calmly on my way , knowing that if I persevere , before long I’ll overtake those who think they can skip over such things .
Well , I wish you the best – it’s very bleak and windy here , which I find particularly annoying because I can’t get on with the townscapes for C . M . , which I’d otherwise capture in my spare moments . But surely it will become mild again .
With a handshake ,
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Perhaps more effort went into this little drawing than into many a watercolour . I sent it to blvd Montmartre so that you could immediately mount it and press it flat .
