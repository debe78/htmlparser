Letter|My dear friend Signac ,
Thanks very much for your postcard , which gives me news of you . As for my brother not having replied to your letter yet , I’m inclined to believe that it’s not his fault . I’ve also been without news of him for a fortnight . It’s because he’s in Holland , where he’s getting married one of these days . Now , while not denying the advantages of a marriage in the very least , once it has been done and one is quietly set up in one’s home , the funereal pomp of the reception &amp ; c . , the lamentable congratulations of two families (even civilized) at the same time , not to mention the fortuitous appearances in those pharmacist’s jars where antediluvian civil or religious magistrates sit – my word – isn’t there good reason to pity the poor unfortunate obliged to present himself armed with the requisite papers in the places where , with a ferocity unequalled by the cruellest cannibals , you’re married alive on the low heat of the aforementioned funereal receptions .
 
I remain much obliged to you for your most friendly and beneficial visit , which considerably contributed to cheering me up .
I am well now and I’m working in the hospital or its surroundings . Thus I’ve just brought back two studies of orchards .
[sketch A]
Here’s a hasty croquis of them – the largest is a poor green countryside with little cottages , blue line of the Alpilles , white and blue sky . The foreground , enclosures with reed hedges where little peach trees are in blossom – everything there is small , the gardens , the fields , the gardens , the trees , even those mountains , as in certain Japanese landscapes , that’s why this subject attracted me .
The other landscape is almost all green with a little lilac and grey – on a rainy day .
Very pleased to hear you say that you’ve settled down , and will very much wish to have more news of you . How is work going , what is the character of those parts?

Since then my mind has returned yet more to the normal state , for the time being I don’t ask for better , provided it lasts . That will depend above all on a very sober regime .
For the first few months , at least , I plan to go on staying here . I’ve rented an apartment consisting of two very small rooms . But at times it isn’t completely convenient for me to start living again , for I still have inner despairs of quite a large calibre .
My word , these anxieties . . . who can live in modern life without catching his share of them?
The best consolation , if not the only remedy , is , it still seems to me , profound friendships , even if these have the disadvantage of anchoring us in life more solidly than may appear desirable to us in the days of great suffering .
Thank you again for your visit , which gave me so much pleasure .
Good handshake in thought .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
Address until end of April , place Lamartine 2 , Arles .
