Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve already left it too long before answering your last letter — and you’ll see how it came about . Let me start by saying that I thank you for your letter and for the enclosed 200 francs . And then I’ll tell you that today I’ve just about finished arranging a spacious new studio I’ve rented . Two rooms — one large and one small — en suite . I’ve been rather busy because of it this last fortnight . I believe I’ll be able to work a good deal more pleasantly there than in the little room at home . And hope that you’ll approve the step I’ve taken when you’ve seen it .
By the way , of late I’ve continued working hard on the large Weaver — which I mentioned to you recently — and also started a canvas of the little tower you know .
I think what you write about the Salon is very important . What you say about Puvis de Chavannes gives me very great pleasure that you see his work thus , and I’m in complete agreement with you in appreciating his talent .
 
And as regards the colourists — it’s after all the same with me as with you — I can immerse myself in a Puvis de Chavannes , and yet that doesn’t alter the fact that I should feel the same for Mauve’s landscape with cows and Israëls’s paintings as you feel for them .
As regards my own colour , in the work I’m doing here you’ll find not silvery but rather brown tones (Bitumen , for instance , and Bistre) — which I don’t doubt some people would take amiss of me . But you’ll see for yourself what it’s like when you come . I’ve been so busy painting that recently I haven’t made a single drawing between times .
I’ve heard from Rappard that he’s coming at the end of this week , which pleases me greatly . What’s more , I have the idea that this year he’ll come back again for a little longer .
He’s bringing a number of drawings of mine , which I’ll then send you right away .
Perhaps — in a while — I’ll agree with you that my position has improved because of the change last year , and that that change was good .
 
It will always be a sadness to me , though , that I had to give something up then that I’d have liked to pursue further at the time .
Ma is doing very well , in my view — yesterday she came to my new studio in her bath chair . Walking is getting better , although old age considerably frustrates her progress , which continues regularly now , although not as fast as one might think could be the case .
I’ve recently been getting on better with the people here than at the outset , which is worth a great deal to me , for one has a definite need to be able to give oneself a little distraction , and when one feels too lonely the work always suffers in consequence . One must , however , perhaps prepare oneself that these things won’t last for ever .
But I’m in good heart — it seems to me that the people in Nuenen are generally better than those in Etten or Helvoirt — there’s more sincerity here — at least that’s my impression now that I’ve been here a while .
  People do take a sanctimonious position in what they do — that’s true — but in such a way that for my part I have no scruples about going along with it a bit . And reality sometimes comes very close to the Brabant that one has dreamt .
My original plan of settling in Brabant — which fell to pieces — I must confess is attracting me strongly again . Yet knowing how something like that can collapse , we have to see whether or not it would be an illusion . Anyway , I have enough to do for the time being . I now have the space again to be able to work with a model .
And as to how long it will last , there’s no telling .
Well , regards — the Salon will certainly give you plenty to do , but at the same time also be an interesting time .
Thanks again for what you sent , which I really needed because of this change , by the way . I hope you’ll be able to agree with it when you see how I’ve fitted it out .
Adieu , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
Regards from everyone at home , and they ask whether you won’t write to them sometime . Pa has been to Breda ; Aunt Bertha was doing well and the dressing had been taken off .
