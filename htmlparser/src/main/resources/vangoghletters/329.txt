Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Last Sunday I was at Van der Weele’s . Saw a painting by him there that I think is by far the most beautiful of his that I know . It was of several sand-carts by the side of a channel or canal . In the mist . It perhaps bore some resemblance to the work of Mauve , both in subject and in the approach and execution . Inasmuch as it was done in the same spirit but with enough personality to be absolutely original and singular . The dimensions were rather large . I write this to point out that Van der W . is one of the rising men , in my view . And I wish you knew him personally ; now the woodcuts may provide an opportunity for getting acquainted , it seems to me . Either through you bringing him those prints sooner or later (I mean the Herkomer , and whatever else you may find) , or through them becoming his with me as intermediary , I may name you as the donor and tell him that you’ve seen something of his work and would like to make his acquaintance , or something like that . In short , I just mean that if you’re put in touch with him one way or another I believe you’ll find in him someone with whom you’ll want to keep in touch and probably become real friends .
Today I sent you a roll of woodcuts . They’re the double-page engravings from The Graphic . I have more of them , but some are probably not suitable for rolling up , since they’re mounted and have had tears repaired and are less important . But these are the sheets I believe you certainly don’t have as yet , and all
  those that I would give to Van der W . , provided you already had them .
And you can verify whether or not you already have them and if you do , return them .
You can sort the others out later , but I think it would be good to have a look at the most important woodcuts in this way , since if you come to visit we’ll need time for other things as well . Then at least that will be out of the way .
As soon as I have time I’ll go through the smaller ones too and send you what I think you may not have for further verification as to whether or not you do .
For now from the smaller ones I’m adding just 2 Lançon which , since they’re French , might get forgotten later when I’m sorting The Graphics but which will undoubtedly please you , at least if you don’t already have them . Isn’t Board School by Holl superb? and Ploughing by Small and Caxton printing?
You doubtless have winter weather again in Utrecht .
Enclosed is a scratch out of the window . I always find it wonderfully cosy to sit by a fire in the dusk and to look through the window at a snow-covered landscape .
I’ve also found that natural chalk here in town . It’s an article that was practically unknown to me until now . Now , though , I find it isn’t that rare — and you probably know it and already have it . If not , I think it a singular medium in which to draw . Adieu , old chap , a handshake in thought . Write soon , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
