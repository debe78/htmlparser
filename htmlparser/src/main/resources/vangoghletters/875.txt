Letter|My dear Theo , my dear Jo ,
Thank you for your letter which I received this morning , and for the fifty francs that were inside it .
Today I saw Dr Gachet again , and I’m going to paint at his place on Tuesday morning , then I’m going to lunch with him and afterwards he’ll come to see my painting . He seems very reasonable to me , but is as discouraged in his profession of country doctor as I with my painting . So I told him that I would , however , gladly swap profession for profession . Anyway , I readily think that I’ll end up being friends with him . He told me , besides , that if melancholy or something else were to become too strong for me to bear , he could well do something again to lessen its intensity , and that I mustn’t be embarrassed to be open with him . Well , that moment when I have need of him may indeed come , however up to today things are going well . And they may get even better , I still believe that it’s above all an illness of the south that I caught , and that the return here will be enough to dispel all that .
Often , very often , I think of your little one , and I then tell myself that I would like him to be big enough to come to the country . For it’s the best system of bringing them up here . How I would like you , Jo and the one to have a rest in the country instead of the traditional journey to Holland . Yes , I’m well aware that Mother will absolutely want to see the little one , and it’s certainly a reason to go there . However , she would certainly understand if it were really in the little one’s best interests .
Here we’re far enough from Paris for it to be the real countryside , but nevertheless , how changed since Daubigny . But not changed in an unpleasant way , there are many villas and various modern and middle-class dwellings , very jolly , sunny and covered with flowers .
  That in an almost lush countryside , just at this moment of the development of a new society in the old one , has nothing disagreeable about it ; there’s a lot of well-being in the air . I see or think I see a calm there à la Puvis de Chavannes , no factories , but beautiful greenery in abundance and in good order .
When you have the opportunity , will you tell me which painting Miss Boch bought? I must write to her to thank them , and then I would propose the exchange of two of my studies for one by each of them .
Enclosed is a note which you will please send to Isaäcson .
I have a drawing of an old vineyard of which I plan to do a no . 30 canvas , then a study of pink chestnut trees and one of white chestnut trees . But if circumstances permit , I hope to do a little figure work . Paintings vaguely present themselves to my sight which it will take time to shape , but that will come little by little . If I hadn’t been ill , I would have written to Boch and to Isaäcson long since . My trunk hasn’t arrived yet , which annoys me , I sent a telegram this morning .
Thank you in advance for the canvas and the paper . Yesterday and today it rains and is stormy , but it isn’t unpleasant to see these effects again . The beds haven’t arrived either . But despite these annoyances , I feel happy no longer to be so far from you all and our friends . I hope that your health will be good . It seemed to me , though , that you had less appetite than before , and from what the doctors say , we should have very solid food for our temperaments . So be sensible about it , especially Jo too , as she has her to feed . Truly , the amount should be doubled , it wouldn’t be any exaggeration when there are children to make and feed . Without that it’s like a train moving slowly where the route is straight . Time enough to reduce steam when the route is more uneven . Handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
