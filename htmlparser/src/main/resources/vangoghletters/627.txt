Letter|My dear Russell
For ever so long I have been wanting to write to you — but then the work has so taken me up . We have harvest time here at present and I am always in the fields .
And when I sit down to write I am so abstracted by recollections of what I have seen that I leave the letter . For instance at the present occasion I was writing to you and going to say something about Arles as it is — and as it was in the old days of Boccaccio .
Well , instead of continuing the letter I began to draw on the very paper the head of a dirty little girl I saw this afternoon whilst I was painting a view of the river with a greenish yellow sky .
This dirty ‘mudlark’ I thought yet had a vague florentine sort of figure like the heads in the Monticelli pictures , and reasoning and drawing this wise I worked on the letter
  I was writing to you . I enclose the slip of scribbling , that you may judge of my abstractions and forgive my not writing before as such .
Do not however imagine I am painting old florentine scenery — no , I may dream of such — but I spend my time in painting and drawing landscapes or rather studies of colour . The actual inhabitants of this country often remind me of the figures we see in Zola’s work .
And Manet would like them as they are and the city as it is .
Bernard is still in Brittany and I believe he’s working hard and doing well . Gauguin is in Brittany too but has again suffered of an attack of his liver complaint . I wished I were in the same place with him or he here with me .
My brother has an exhibition of 10 new pictures by Claude Monet , his latest works , for instance a landscape with red sun set and a group of dark firtrees by the seaside .
 
The red sun casts an orange or blood red reflection on the blue green trees and the ground . I wished I could see them .
How is your house in Brittany getting on — and have you been working in the country?
I believe my brother has also another picture by Gauguin which is as I heard say very fine , two negro women talking . It is one of those he did at Martinique .
MacKnight told me he had seen a picture by Monticelli in Marseille , flower-piece .
Very soon I intend sending over some studies to Paris and then you can , if you like , choose one for our exchange .
I must hurry off this letter for I feel some more abstractions coming on and if I did not quickly fill up my paper I would again set to drawing and you would not have your letter .
 
I heard Rodin had a beautiful head at the Salon .
I have been to the seaside for a week and very likely am going thither again soon . Flat shore sands — fine figures there like Cimabue – straight , stylish .
Am working at a Sower .

The great field all violet , the sky and sun very yellow . It is a hard subject to treat .
Please remember me very kindly to Mrs Russell — and in thought I heartily shake hands .
Yours very truly ,
Vincent
