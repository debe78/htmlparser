The Hague , 24 March 1873
My dear Theo ,
Would you mind checking whether a painting by Schotel is still in Brussels?
It was sent from here on consignment on 6 May 1870 , but perhaps Uncle has already sent it back to Paris .
If that isn’t the case , however , see that it’s sent here immediately .
  We have every chance of selling it , but time is of the essence .
I saw it last summer in your gallery , and imagine it’s probably still there .
Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt and Mr Schmidt and Eduard for me .
You’ll have received my letter by now . Adieu , I wish you well .
Vincent
