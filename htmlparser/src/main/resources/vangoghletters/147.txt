My dear Theo ,
I’m enclosing a few words with Pa and Ma’s letter to bid you good morning . It’s raining outside and has done so a lot lately , with strong winds too . It was nice the day Anna and Joan registered their banns . Now that Joan is here , Anna looks a lot more cheerful and better than before . For their honeymoon they’re thinking of making a journey through Belgium , first to Brussels and from there probably south to Liège or Chaudfontaine or the cave in Han . Wrote and told the Rev . De Jonge that I was ready to come to Brussels straightaway if work or duty should call me , but that if there were no sound reasons that made it desirable for me to go there now , I’d like to stay here another week (because of Anna’s wedding) , coming in that case before Sunday , 25 Aug .
 
I’m very curious to know whether the exhibition of paintings there will still be open , I should so much like to see it .
Things are very sad at Princenhage , Aunt suffers a lot , and they’re all very worried about her .
I long for a word from you , hope to write to you in more detail as soon as I’m in Brussels , also about the exhibition , at least if it isn’t over yet .
Give my regards to Braat and Soek , if you see them , and Ernest . Adieu , I wish you the very best , not a day goes by that we don’t speak of you . Do write again soon , and accept a hearty handshake in thought from
Your loving brother
Vincent
In haste .
