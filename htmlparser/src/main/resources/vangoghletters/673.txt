Letter|My dear Theo ,
Yesterday I spent another day with that Belgian— who also has a among the Vingtistes — — the weather wasn’t good but it was a jolly good day for chatting ; we went for a walk , and all the same we did see some very fine things at the bullfights and outside the town . We talked more seriously about the plan that if I keep on lodgings in the south , he should definitely set up a kind of post in the coal-fields . That then Gauguin and he and I , in cases where the importance of a painting would be a reason for travelling , could exchange places — sometimes being in the north , but in a familiar part of the country where we have a friend , sometimes in the south . You’ll see him soon , this young man with the Dante-like face , because he’s coming to Paris , and if the room’s available you’ll be doing him a favour by putting him up . He’s quite distinguished in appearance , and he’ll become so in his paintings , I believe . He likes Delacroix , and we talked a lot about Delacroix yesterday ; actually he knew the violent sketch of Christ’s boat .
  Ah well , thanks to him — at last I have a first sketch of that painting I’ve been dreaming about for a long time — the poet . He posed for it for me . His fine head , with its green gaze , stands out in my portrait against a starry , deep ultramarine sky ; his clothing is a little yellow jacket , a collar of unbleached linen , a multicoloured tie . He gave me two sittings in one day .
Yesterday I received a letter from our , who has seen many things . Ah , if she could marry an artist , that wouldn’t be bad .
Well , we’ll have to go on urging her to untangle her personality , rather than her artistic abilities .
I’ve finished Daudet’s L’immortel — I rather like the remark by the sculptor Védrine , who says that achieving fame is something like when smoking , sticking your cigar in your mouth by the lighted end .
Now I definitely like L’immortel less , much less , than Tartarin .
 
You know , it seems to me that L’immortel isn’t as fine as Tartarin for colour , because , with its quantity of subtle and accurate observations , it makes me think of Jean Béraud’s disheartening paintings , so dry , so cold . Tartarin , now , is so genuinely great — with the greatness of a masterpiece , just like Candide .
I would very much like to ask you to expose my studies from down here , which aren’t completely dry yet , to the air as far as possible . If they stayed shut away or in the dark , the colours would deteriorate . So , the portrait of the young girl , the harvest (wide landscape with the ruin in the background and the chain of the Alpilles) , the small seascape , the garden with the weeping tree and the conifer bushes , if you could put them on stretching frames that would be good . I’m a little attached to those .
You can see clearly from the drawing of the small seascape that that one’s the most worked up .
I’m having 2 oak frames made , for my new head of a peasant and for my study of a poet . Ah , my dear brother , sometimes I know so clearly what I want . In life and in painting too , I can easily do without the dear Lord , but I
  can’t , suffering as I do , do without something greater than myself , which is my life , the power to create .
And if frustrated in this power physically , we try to create thoughts instead of children ; in that way , we’re part of humanity all the same . And in a painting I’d like to say something consoling , like a piece of music . I’d like to paint men or women with that je ne sais quoi of the eternal , of which the halo used to be the symbol , and which we try to achieve through the radiance itself , through the vibrancy of our colorations .
The portrait conceived in this way doesn’t become an Ary Scheffer , because there’s a blue sky behind it , as in the Saint Augustine . Because Ary Scheffer is so little of a colourist .
But this would be more in tune with what Eugène Delacroix was looking for and found in his Tasso in prison and so many other paintings depicting a true man . Ah , the portrait — the portrait with the model’s thoughts , his soul — it so much seems to me that it must come .
 
We talked a lot yesterday , the Belgian and I , about the advantages and disadvantages of this place . We quite agree on both . And on the immense interest that would hold for us , to be able to move about , sometimes the north , sometimes the south . He’s going to stay with MacKnight again for reasons of living more cheaply .
That , though , has a disadvantage for him , I believe , because living with an idler makes you idle . I believe you’ll enjoy meeting him , he’s still young . I believe that he’ll ask your advice on buying Japanese prints and Daumier lithographs . For those , the Daumiers , it would be good to buy more , because later on we won’t be able to find them .
The Belgian was saying that with MacKnight he paid 80 francs for board and lodging . What a difference , then , living together — myself I have to pay 45 a month for my lodging alone . And so I always come back to the same calculation , that with Gauguin I’ll spend no more than on my own , and that without suffering thereby .
 
Now for them , it’s to be taken into account that they were very badly housed , not in terms of their beds , but of the possibility of working at home .
So I’m still between two currents of ideas , the first , material difficulties , turning this way and that to build up an existence , and then the study of colour . I still have hopes of finding something there . To express the love of two lovers through a marriage of two complementary colours , their mixture and their contrasts , the mysterious vibrations of adjacent tones . To express the thought of a forehead through the radiance of a light tone on a dark background . To express hope through some star . The ardour of a living being through the rays of a setting sun . That’s certainly not trompe-l’oeil realism , but isn’t it something that really exists? More soon ; I’ll tell you when the Belgian might pass through , because I’ll see him again tomorrow .
Handshake .
Ever yours , Vincent
The Belgian said that at home they have a Degroux , the sketch for Saying grace in the Brussels museum .
The portrait of the Belgian has something of the portrait of Reid that you have , in terms of execution .
