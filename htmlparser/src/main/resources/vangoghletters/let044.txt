My dear Theo ,
I’m sending you herewith my letter for Ma’s birthday , please enclose it with yours . I’ve bought a book about Michel , with etchings after his paintings ; I’ll send it to you as soon as I’ve finished it . Michel , though , isn’t nearly so beautiful as that landscape described in that passage in Adam Bede , which we both found so moving . Bonington ,
  too , almost painted it , and yet that isn’t it either .
When you’ve finished the book I’d like to ask you to give it in my name to Uncle Cor to read , when you have the opportunity of course , though I’m giving it to you . I see the paintings themselves , so naturally you can have the description and etchings after them .
My regards to the Haanebeeks , Carbentuses , Van Stockums , Mauve , Rooses &amp ; c . if the occasion presents itself . I wish you the very best . Ever
Your loving brother
Vincent
Give the book on Michel to Mr Tersteeg to read , too .
