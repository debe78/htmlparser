Paris , 9 Nov . 1875 .
My dear Theo ,
It’s time you heard from me again , though this will only be a short note , for I haven’t much time .
Thanks for what you sent me , I’m glad to have it . I’m glad that you were in Etten on the day of the induction , for Pa and Ma’s sake as well as yours . You must write and tell me what it was like .
Uncle Vincent and Aunt left yesterday . I went to see them quite often . I’m sorry I didn’t see them at the train yesterday when they left . Herewith a letter , give it to Uncle when you see him , it explains why we didn’t see each other at the station .
 
Autumn is really here , you’ll be going for walks fairly often . Do you get up early? I do regularly , it’s good to make a habit of it . It’s precious and already very dear to me , that early morning twilight . I usually go to bed early in the evening . Every morning my Englishman cooks barley porridge ; how I’d like you to be here in the morning sometime .
Anna seems to get up early as well . She doesn’t have it easy , and she certainly makes herself very useful .
Well , more soon , probably . Do write again soon , and freely .
I shake your hand in thought , and am ever
Your loving brother
Vincent
