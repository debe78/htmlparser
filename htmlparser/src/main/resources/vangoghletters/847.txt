My dear Vincent ,
Dr Peyron writes to me that you have again been seized by an attack of your illness . My poor brother , I’m infinitely sorry that things aren’t going as they should . Fortunately , the previous times this didn’t
  last long , and so we hope with all possible fervour that you may soon be better this time too . It’s the only cloud in our happiness , for my dear brother , the bad moment for Jo is over . She has brought into the world a fine who cries a lot but who seems to be in good health . My poor little wife suffered a great deal because the waters broke too soon , but fortunately we had an excellent doctor with extraordinary patience , for any other in his place would
  certainly have used the forceps . Jo is very well and hasn’t yet had any fever , but it could still come .
The is already beginning to cry lustily . How happy I’d be if in a while , when Jo’s well again , you’ll be able to come and see her and see our little one! As we told you , we’ll name him after you , and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you . As soon as you can ,
  write to me to tell me how you are and if there were any incidents that provoked the new crisis .
We often talk about you and we think about you even more . I hope with all my heart that you may soon be better .
Be of good heart and
Ever yours ,
Theo
