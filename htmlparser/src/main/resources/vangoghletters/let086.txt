My dear Theo ,
Your letter and the prints came as a wonderful surprise this morning while I was weeding the potatoes in the garden . I thank you ; the two engravings , Christus Consolator and Remunerator , are already hanging above my reading-desk in my room . God is just , so He will use persuasion to bring those who stray back to the straight path , that’s what you were thinking of when you wrote , may it come to pass . I’m straying in many ways , but there’s still hope . Don’t worry about your wanton life , as you call it , just go quietly on your way . You’re purer than I , and will probably get there sooner and better .
Don’t have too great illusions about the freedom I have ; I have my bonds of various kinds , humiliating bonds some of them , and this will only get worse with time ; but the words inscribed above Christus Consolator , ‘He is come to preach deliverance to the captives’ , are still true today .
 
Now I have a request to make of you . Back then in The Hague I went to a catechist , Hillen , who was living in Bagijnestraat at the time . He took great pains over me and , although I didn’t show it , what he said made an impression on me , and I have a mind to write a word or two to him , perhaps it would give him pleasure .
Go and find him if you have the time and can discover his address , and tell him that I’ve become a schoolmaster and , who knows , may later find some kind of situation connected with the church . He’s a very modest man , one who has struggled a lot , I believe ; sometimes when I went to see him and took a look at him I couldn’t help thinking that the end of that man will be peace .
And give him the enclosed drawing for me .
How much I’d like to look in on Mauve sometime , what you describe , what you saw the evening you were there , I can picture clearly , as it were . Do write again soon , I wish you well , and believe me
Your most loving brother
Vincent .
Please give my regards to Mr Tersteeg and his wife and Betsy , and to everyone at Rooses’ , and anyone else you might see . Don’t tell them about me , though . Tell Jan and Piet I bid them good-day as well . As you see , I’ve ended up at the other school after all , herewith two prospectuses . If you can recommend the school to anyone wishing to send their boys to England , then do so .
