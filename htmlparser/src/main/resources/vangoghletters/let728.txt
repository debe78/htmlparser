Arles, 2 January 1889
My dear Theo,
In order to reassure you completely on my account I‘m writing you these few words in the office of Mr Rey, the house physician, whom you saw yourself. I‘ll stay here at the hospital for another few days — then I dare plan to return home very calmly. Now I ask just one thing of you, not to worry, for that would cause me one worry too many.
Now let‘s talk about our friend Gauguin, did I terrify him? In short, why doesn‘t he give me a sign of life? He must have left with you.
Besides, he needed to see Paris again, and perhaps he‘ll feel more at home in Paris than here. Tell Gauguin to write to me, and that I‘m still thinking of him.
Good handshake, I‘ve read and re-read your letter about the meeting with Bongers. It‘s perfect. As for me, I‘m content to remain as I am. Once again, good handshake to you and Gauguin.
Ever yours
Vincent
Write to me, still same address, 2 place Lamartine.
 
[Continued by Félix Rey]
Sir –
I shall add a few words to your brother‘s letter to reassure you, in my turn, on his account.
I am happy to tell you that my predictions have been borne out, and that this over-excitement was only fleeting. I strongly believe that he will have recovered in a few days‘ time.
I very much wanted him to write to you himself, to give you a better account of his condition.
I have had him brought down to my office to talk a little. It will entertain me and do him good.
With my sincerest regards.
Rey F.
