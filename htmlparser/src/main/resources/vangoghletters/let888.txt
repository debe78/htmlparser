Letter|Paris 15 July 1890
My dear Vincent,
I’m really pleased that the news you give us remains good, and that the courage for work is far from abandoning you.
Tasset is to send you the colours you ask for today. Tanguy was telling me the other day that the tubes from Tasset were much shorter and therefore contained less paint than his. If that was the case tell me, for I can make use of that to have a reduction
  in the price. It will be much calmer for you when your furniture has arrived too, so that you may perhaps be able to find a colleague to stay with you. There’s a Dutchman who’ll come and see you, he was recommended by De Bock who had recommended Fontainebleau to him, but he doesn’t find it to his taste. I don’t know if he has any talent, he had nothing to show. Lauzet came yesterday morning to see your paintings, he’s very busy with his Monticelli, which are going to be published in ten days’ time. He very much likes the portrait of a you did in Arles. It’s perhaps just what he needs for his Martinique project, but if it’s to depend on a payment to an inventor it isn’t yet
  really certain. Enclosed with this letter you’ll find a letter from him which he asked me to send you. His stay with Schuffenecker isn’t doing him any good, he’s hardly working at all there, whereas Brittany inspires him. So it’s good that he’s leaving.
I give you Jo’s regards, I must finish in haste, otherwise the letter won’t go off today. She’s a little indisposed, but I hope that it won’t be anything serious.
Good handshake.
Theo
