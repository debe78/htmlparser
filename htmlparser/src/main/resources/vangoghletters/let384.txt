Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve just received your letter and the 100 francs enclosed . And I leave tomorrow for Hoogeveen in Drenthe . Then on from there , and from there I’ll give you an address .
So don’t write any more to here in any event . And I would suggest you write a word to C . M . right away to inform him of my departure because , as you say yourself , there’s the possibility that he might write to me at this address . If he has already done so , it would be best if he asked at the post office for the letter to be returned for , not knowing exactly what my next address will be , I can only inform the post here or the landlord later on .
Friend Rappard is also travelling , and already has Drenthe behind him and is nearly on Terschelling . He wrote to me from Drenthe ‘the country here is very earnest in mood , the figures often made me think of studies by you . As for life here , one could certainly not live more cheaply anywhere else . And I think that the south-east corner (the area I have in mind) is the most original . ’
 
Theo , I certainly have a feeling of melancholy on leaving , much more so than would have been the case had I been convinced that the would be energetic and that her good will wasn’t in doubt . Anyway , you know the gist from one thing and another . For my part I must press on or I myself will sink without getting her any further by that . Until she becomes more active of her own accord , namely more steadily instead of in short bursts , she’ll remain on the same inadequate spot , and even if she had 3 helpers in my place they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it unless she herself cooperated . But the to whom one’s heart goes out? I couldn’t do everything for them , but if only the woman had been willing!
I shan’t go on moaning , though , for I must press on nonetheless .
Well , to be on the safe side I didn’t dare to take paint along , for over there I’ll soon have to pay for my things when they arrive , then lodgings and more travel expenses . But if we’re lucky enough to get something from C . M . , I’ll have one or two things I’ve picked out sent there by parcel post . The sooner that can be done the better . So if you hear anything , write to me as soon as you know my address over there , and of course I agree with the proposed arrangement (regarding the partial reimbursement of the 100 francs) ; indeed , if you’re hard up , wait for a favourable moment before sending everything that might come from him .
I , for one , think that C . M . might just do nothing at all .
In any event , brother , it was firm and well advised of you to send this immediately . For now I’ll be over there and able to get my bearings , and we
  can certainly economize ourselves even if no help comes . So thanks for this , and I believe it’ll prove to be a good step . My plan is to stay there until you come to Holland next year , for instance . I wouldn’t want to miss you then . But in that way I would just see all the seasons go by and have a general view of the character of things in that region .
I’ve equipped myself with an internal passport , valid for 12 months . With which I have the right to go where I will and to stay in one place for as long or as short as I please .
So I’m very glad that I can make progress , for in this way we help ourselves ; over there I reckon 50 francs for board and lodging and the rest on the work , and that’s a big difference from what I was able to do here in the circumstances . So even if others won’t help , we won’t be idle .
Regards , for I still have a lot to arrange today — write a short letter to C . M . — and in the next few days you’ll receive a message with my address , by tomorrow evening if all goes well . Adieu , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
You wrote to me recently ‘perhaps your duty will induce you to behave differently or something’ . That’s something I immediately thought about a great deal , and because my work so undoubtedly demands the step of going there , it’s my understanding that work is more directly duty than even the , and that the former mustn’t suffer for the sake of the latter . Which was different last year , since in my view I’m now exactly at the point of Drenthe . But one has divided feelings and would like to do both , which cannot be in the circumstances , both because of the money and , more than that , because she can’t be counted on .
