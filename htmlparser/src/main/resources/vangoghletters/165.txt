My dear Theo ,
Having heard from Pa that there’s a chance you’ll be coming to Etten this Sunday , and Pa having written to me that it would be good if I were there as well , I set out for there today .
So I hope to meet you soon , which I look forward to with great eagerness , also because I sketched two drawings at Rappard’s , ‘The lamp-bearers’ and ‘The bearers of the burden’ , the further execution of which I wanted to discuss with you . To finish them I must , one way or another , have the necessary models , and then I’m confident that something good will come of them , namely a couple of compositions that I can show to Smeeton Tilly or the people from L’Illustration or suchlike .
So I’m leaving today and am telling you this lest you should perhaps look for me in Brussels . In Etten I’d like to make a few sketches on the heath , which is why I’m going a couple of days earlier .
So I hope we see each other soon , and shake your hand in thought .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
