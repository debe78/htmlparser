Letter|My dear Theo ,
Today I sent — carriage paid — crate V4 with the still lifes .
To my regret , the two little sketches of Amsterdam are quite badly damaged . They got wet on the journey ; then the little panels warped when they dried , and dust &amp ; c . got into them . I’m sending them all the same to show you that if , in the space of an hour , I want to dash off an impression somewhere , I’m beginning to be able to do this in the same sentiment as others who — analyze — their impressions . And give themselves a reason for what they see . This is something other than feeling , that’s to say undergoing impressions — there may perhaps be a great deal between experiencing impressions and — analyzing them , that’s to say taking them apart and putting them together again . But it’s enjoyable to put something down in a rush .
What particularly struck me when I saw the old Dutch paintings again is that they were usually painted quickly . That these great masters like Hals , Rembrandt , Ruisdael — so many others — as far as possible just put it straight down — and didn’t come back to it so very much .
 
And — this , too , please — that if it worked , they left it alone .
Above all I admired hands by Rembrandt and Hals — hands that lived , but were not finished in the sense that people want to enforce nowadays . Particular hands in the Syndics even , in the Jewish bride , in Frans Hals .
And heads , too — eyes , nose , mouth done with the first brushstrokes , without any sort of retouching . Unger , Bracquemond etched it well — as it was done , and one can see the manner of painting in their etchings .
Theo , how necessary it is at this time to look at old Dutch paintings now and again! And at the French paintings , Corot , Millet &amp ; c . The rest , one can if necessary do without them very well — and upset some people more than they think .
 
Paint in one go , as far as possible in one go . What a joy it is to see a Frans Hals like that — how very different it is from the paintings — there are so many of them — where everything has been carefully smoothed out in the same way .
I happened to see a Meissonier (the one at the Fodor) on the same day that I saw old Dutch masters , Brouwer , Ostade , Ter Borch in particular . Well then — Meissonier does it like them — a very considered , very calculated touch — but — on in one go and , if possible , right in one go .
I think it’s better to take off a part that goes wrong with a palette knife and start again from the beginning than to keep coming back to it .
Now — I saw a sketch by Rubens and a sketch by Diaz , too , as it were at the same time . They were by no means the same , but the belief that the colour expresses the form when it’s in its place and in its context — that they do have in common . At any rate Diaz is a painter to the core — and he was conscientious to the tips of his fingers .
 
The Diaz in the Fodor is only sketchy , but perhaps precisely because of this it was a real joy for me , who hadn’t seen one in years , to see one again , and it stood up very well , even when one had just seen the way the old masters went about it .
I must just come back to certain present-day paintings that are becoming more and more numerous . Some 10 , 15 years ago people started to talk about ‘clarity of light’ . It’s true that originally this was a good thing ; it’s a fact that masterly things came about as a result of that system . But where it increasingly degenerates into an overproduction of paintings where all through the painting — in all 4 corners the same light , the same what I think they call day tone and local colour dominates , is this a good thing??? I think not .
Is the Ruisdael in the Van der Hoop , the one with the mill , not outdoors? Is there no sky in it and vast space? And yet — the whole painting is very much darker than the fellows would do , sky and earth moreover form a single whole , belong together .
Van Goyen — that Corot among the Dutchmen — I stood for a long time in front of that masterly piece in the Dupper Collection , two oaks on a dune in the autumn , in a storm .
 
A sentiment indeed , let me say , like Jules Dupré or like The bush .
But there’s ordinary yellow ochre rather than — white — carried through in the painting . Now the Cuyp — the view of Dordrecht in the Van der Hoop — entirely reddish gold — there again — the ochres .
Frans Hals’s yellow — call it what you will , dull lemon or fawn yellow — what’s it done with? It seems very light in the painting — but just try holding white against it .
A great lesson that the old Dutch masters teach , it seems to me , is this: to regard drawing and colour as one — which Bracquemond says too . That now — many do not do it , they draw with everything except with sound colour . Oh Theo , it’s so awful to listen to , it’s so horribly boring when a chap like Haverman , say , talks about ‘technique’ . I don’t say Rappard , because he talks like that too but , fortunately for him , paints better than he talks .
 
I have absolutely no desire to make a lot of acquaintances among the painting gang . But again — speaking of technique — there’s a great deal sounder and more solid technique in Israëls — for instance in that very old work , the Zandvoort fisherman , with superb chiaroscuro — than the technique of those who are equally smooth and flat all over , and distinguished by their cold , tinny colour .
The Zandvoort fisherman , well , just go ahead and hang it next to an old Delacroix , The barque of Dante , and it’s the same family . I believe in that , but every day I dislike the paintings that are equally light all over more and more . It’s an unpleasant thing for me when they say that I have ‘no technique’ — it’s possible that this will blow over because I don’t make the acquaintance of any of the painters . It’s true , on the contrary , that it’s precisely in terms of technique that I find many of the people who prattle on about it the most are weak . I wrote to you about that before . But if I show any of my work in Holland , I know in advance what I have to deal with and with what sort of
  calibre of technicians . Meanwhile , I’d rather go very calmly to the old Dutchmen and rather to the paintings by Israëls and those who have a direct affinity with Israëls , which the newer ones do not . They are , rather , diametrically opposed to Israëls . And I think I’ve observed that Israëls himself , Maris , Mauve , Neuhuys himself , view a certain direction we’re now discussing with nothing but displeasure . A Mesdag , for instance , who was once a terrible realist , as you’ll remember — is becoming more tonal in his later paintings and drawings , and often more mysterious . Anyway .
Witkamp has a devilish lot that’s good — resembles Jules Breton or Bastien-Lepage — but — Jules Breton is warm , and he’s much too cold . And that’s not a fault that’s easy to put right — to get a thing warm , it has to be put on warm , and otherwise one won’t easily get the cold out of it .
In many cases , what they call brightness is an ugly studio tone in a cheerless city studio . It seems people don’t look at the half-light in the early morning or in the evening , it seems nothing exists other than midday from 11-3 — truly a very respectable hour! — but — often as characterless as Jan Salie .
 
But for all that , Theo — I’m devilish poor at present . Painting a lot is expensive — I feel really hard up , and as for the end of the month , it’s miserable . The fact that ‘money is the sinews of war’ sadly can’t be ignored in painting either . Nothing but sorrow comes out of war , though , there is only destruction , and in painting it’s sometimes — sowing — even if the painter doesn’t reap the harvest himself .
How are you and how’s business? I don’t know whether my intuition is right — but judging from the shop windows &amp ; c . &amp ; c . , the Art trade in Amsterdam certainly did not appear to be flourishing — but oh so quiet and respectable . Truly , overconfidence and enthusiasm aren’t the faults(?) of the present day . I hardly spoke to anyone — but indirectly sounded things out because I’m curious as to what the results will be , what it will come to in the art trade . I don’t think you’re exactly overwhelmed with paintings , are you?
In the winter I’m going to explore various things regarding manner that I noticed in the old paintings . I saw a great deal that I needed .
But this above all things — what they call — dashing off — you see that’s what the old Dutch painters did famously .
  That — dashing off — with a few brushstrokes , they won’t hear of it now — but how true the results are . And how masterfully well many French painters , how an Israëls understood precisely that . At the museum — I thought a lot about Delacroix . Why? Because in front of Hals , in front of Rembrandt , in front of Ruisdael and others , I thought constantly of that saying , When Delacroix paints – it’s like the lion devouring his piece of flesh . How true that is — and oh , Theo — when I think about what I’ll call the self-styled technical gang , how deathly it is . Rest assured that if I ever have to do with those gentlemen or come across one of them , I’ll play the innocent — but — à la Vireloque — followed by a cutting remark .
I hate it when things hang fire and go wrong .
And isn’t it something fatal , that forced finishing the same everywhere (what they call finishing!) , everywhere that same boring grey light instead of light and shade — local colour , colour instead of tone? Aren’t those deplorable things — and isn’t it so?
  Anyway — I think these things are wrong because I think Israëls , for instance , so good , because there are so many new and old painters alike whom one can adore .
I should have realized earlier that I’m most probably boring you with this letter . But I simply didn’t think about it ; for my part I can say that I wish you’d write to me about your impressions of things in the Louvre or Luxembourg or of anywhere else .
Write soon , if you will — and be aware that it’s awfully tough for me at the end of the month . All the same , I’m glad I went there , even if it’s at a moment when I can afford the expenditure less than ever . As to that — things will be very hard around New Year , say , but anyway — nothing ventured , nothing gained , and for my part I’ll always resign myself to being in difficulties if it’s for the sake of painting . Regards , hope you’ll get my consignment in good order . There’s a book by De Goncourt about Chardin , Boucher , Watteau and Fragonard — I must read it ; do you or any of your acquaintances have it? I don’t suppose you do , but do you perhaps know whether or not it’s particularly important? Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
