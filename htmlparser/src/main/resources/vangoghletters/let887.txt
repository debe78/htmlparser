Letter|My dear Theo ,
At last I’ve received news about my furniture , the who has it has been ill all the time , having been struck by the horn of one of the bulls while helping to unload them . So his writes to me that it was because of this that they’d put it off from one day to the next , but that on Saturday , today in other words , they’d send it ; they have no luck , the wife having been ill too , and not yet being completely recovered . By the way , there wasn’t one word of reproach in the letter , except that it had upset them that I hadn’t come to see them before leaving , that upset me too .
Enclosed I must send you an order for some colours . I have another study that’s in the genre of the Harvest that’s at your place in the room where the piano is . Fields viewed from a height with a road on which there’s a small carriage .
Currently I’m working on a field of poppies in some lucerne .
And I have a vineyard study , which Mr Gachet liked very much the last time he came to see .
For the moment I have nothing else to say , a letter came from Mother who had been at Nuenen and was very much longing to see you come and to see the one again . A firm handshake for both of you .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
