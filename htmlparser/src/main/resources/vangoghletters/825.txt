My dear Vincent ,
Today we safely received the three rolls of paintings as well as your letter . Among the canvases there are some whose harmony is sought in less dazzling tones than generally ; there is however a lot of atmosphere .
How I agree with you when you say in your last letter
  that you want to work like a cobbler , certainly that won’t prevent you from doing canvases that hold their own alongside those of the masters . What I consider modern times have done for art is that nowadays each person can do as he intends and he isn’t forced to work according to rules established by a school . This being the case , it’s permissible to do a piece of nature simply as one sees it , without being obliged to cut it like this or like that . The fondness the artist has for certain lines and certain colours will cause his soul to be reflected in them in spite of himself .
 
At the World Exhibition there was a little painting by Manet , which perhaps you saw earlier at Portier’s . It shows a young woman in a white dress sitting against a green knoll beside a little carriage with a child inside . The father is lying nonchalantly on the grass behind the woman . This is certainly one of the paintings that aren’t only the most modern , but also in which there is the highest art . I think that the searches for symbolism , for example , need go no further than this painting , and the symbol isn’t deliberate .
Lately Tanguy has been exhibiting a lot of your canvases , he told me
  that he hopes to sell the Bench with the ivy . It’s a fine choice you’ve made for Brussels . I’ve ordered frames . For the Sunflowers I’m leaving the little wooden edge that’s around it , and a white frame around that . For the others , white or natural wood frames . You don’t tell me if you want to exhibit drawings . When Maus was here he liked them very much and asked above all for some to be sent . We could perhaps send several of them in a frame .
You often used to say that a book should be published about Monticelli . Well , I’ve seen about twenty very fine lithographs after him done by someone called Lauzet . There will also be text , the artist is to come and see our paintings to see if there are any he wants to reproduce . It will be especially good for the English
  and the Scottish . The lithographs are printed in different tones , and in terms of the process they somewhat resemble etchings on stone , like Marvy made back then ; the man who did them is a real artist . That friend of Bernard’s called Aurier also came to my place , the one who came to rue Lepic once . He’s very interested in what you’re doing and showed me a little journal he ran in which he talked about Tanguy’s shop , and in which he also mentions your paintings . Here we are in the full throes of winter and there’s snow on the roofs . How’s the climate where you are? I’m writing to Mr Peyron
  to tell him that you’ll probably be obliged to work in a room , and that in that case will he please let you make a fire , the cost of which he can add to my account .
I’m very pleased that you can say that you’re well . For the future , who can say , above all don’t worry yourself more than necessary . One day or another there will indeed be better days for you , and we’ll see each other more often . The Corot , Millet etc . didn’t sell their painting for high prices but they nevertheless ended up selling , but one must have patience .
Jo sends her warm regards , we’ve received a whole consignment of little things for the baby from Amsterdam . You’ll do its portrait when it’s here . Wil is probably coming to lend us a hand in January . They’re enjoying themselves in Leiden .
Be of good heart .
Ever yours ,
Theo
