Letter|Tuesday afternoon
My dear Theo ,
A message from Sien that all is going well , thank God . If that continues , she should leave a fortnight after the birth . This forced me to make a decision about the new house , so that she’d find a warm nest on her return after so much pain . So I reached an understanding with the . First , that right away he’d help me move , namely by letting me have a few men from the yard at the end of an afternoon to carry all my things , because I’m not allowed to lift much , in fact nothing at all . And then that I won’t pay him any rent until either I or the woman actually moves in , for Sien may be back from hospital before I am . Meanwhile I must reach an agreement with the previous for the current month (because I was ill and didn’t know when I would be better , I was unable to give him notice that I was leaving) . I hope to get away with paying for 1 week or a fortnight , anyway I’m not planning to give him the whole month .
 
Perhaps you’ve already sent something – then maybe I’ll find your letter tomorrow morning with the hospital porter . But if you haven’t yet sent , I would ask you to please do so soon because I’m running short and must pay 10 guilders in advance to go back into hospital , so that my going back there depends on your letter . This morning there was still no letter with the porter .
Now the move is largely done . Sien’s is helping me . It’s quite a job , because the whole house is still full of plaster dust and needs to be scrubbed . But the studio and alcove are clean , and nearly all the furniture &amp ; c . has been brought over . Now we’re taking a break to eat .
I’m fine , I feel much better than I’ve done for a long time , but my nether parts are still not completely in order when I pass water . Although walking , being out of doors &amp ; c . agrees with me . Yesterday I spoke briefly to the director of the hospital , Dr Tienhoven , in the street and told him how I was getting on , and he made no objection . So I have hopes of being fully cured soon .
 
If I had designed this new house myself , and had deliberately wanted to fit it out as a studio , I couldn’t have made it better than it is now . And not another house in the street is like this one inside , although from the outside they all look exactly the same . The fact that I’m in it is really the fault of the storm that broke the window of the old studio , for if that hadn’t happened I would never have known about this house . It was on that occasion that the carpenter drew it to my attention and said , why don’t you move next door?
Well brother , and during the move I’ve dashed off another drawing , a watercolour again . Based on a sketch done before my illness that was only half finished . So it’s coming to life again . It shows pinks on the beach , big hulls
  of boats lying in the hot sand with the sea very far off in a blue mist or haze , for it was a day with sun , but it’s with the light behind , not into it , so that you have to feel the sun through a few short cast shadows and the shimmering of the warm air above the sand . It’s only an impression but I believe it’s fairly accurate . My fingers are itching so much to get back to work , and needless to say I would rather have gone to Scheveningen than to the hospital . Still , what must be must be .
Now I’m longing for your letter and even more for your arrival — provided I’m not then in the hospital . And for what you’ll say about the new house . And for what you’ll think of Sien when you see her , and of the new clever-clogs . I do hope you’ll feel some sympathy for Sien , because she deserves it . Another thing… Might there be any more Ingres paper of the same thickness as the enclosed sample in your part of the world , ideally with slightly more tone? If so , bring some when you come , together with those of my sketches that you have but don’t want to keep . Of course I hope that you’ll definitely keep Sorrow and the best of them , and the large Sorrow . Adieu , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
