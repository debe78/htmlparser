Letter|My dear Theo ,
You must know that I mean what I say to you regarding the . You must know that all the disappointment that your visit this summer caused me — more than you know — in so far as it touched me personally , it isn’t something that I’ll attach much importance to — but the other thing — namely that I found her again in such a state that my heart melted in me — that — it will remain — something insurmountable between you and me — unless she is yet saved .
You were careless with your words then — you didn’t consider what you were saying and evidently spoke without sufficient grounds — and I’ll tell you straight out what I think about that — that in common with Pa , who often acts thus , you are cruel in your worldly wisdom .
Cruel , I repeat , because what is crueller than to deprive such an unfortunate , withered and her little of support? Don’t think that you can fool yourself that it was nothing , or just my imagination ; don’t think that it will help you to argue that this is just about one faded whore and her bastards . All the more reason for profound compassion , in my view . Which I indeed displayed .
I have now realized that in all that time YOU never wrote a single word about , and didn’t reply when I told you I’d heard from her .
And I now realize several other things , and because I realize them now I no longer speak to you in the same tone as before .
 
I do know that you did it with good intentions under the circumstances — I do know how you try to keep the peace with everyone (which I believe can’t be done) — I do know that even in this case you’re probably not actually aware of having done something that wasn’t right — yet — brother — remaining good friends with the world and following our conscience cannot go together . You don’t give your conscience its due . I also know that not everyone in my case and circumstances would undertake to contradict you , but although not everyone would do that , I at least want to tell you that I do hold something against you in this matter , and that in general I warn you against your policy . Which I find TOO politic .
For I foresee that later (perhaps much later) you’ll regret much of what you now take to be right . For the time being I don’t have to give you any reason why I think that , because you wouldn’t believe me .
The time that I was parted from has largely spoiled again what had been gained for her well-being , and this is making it more and more difficult now . Is there anything still to be done? — but in what way?
This is truly not a question of money alone , for the poor also misses me as I was for her and her , namely that I loved them , and still feel as much if not more for them now .
 
Be so good as to take back what you write in a certain letter ‘that I would do and myself a disservice’ ; mindful of the service you did her and her children and me this summer , you’d best keep quiet about that!
You presume moreover , in the letter in question , which contains the only reference to her that you’ve written since this summer — you presume that I would want to take ‘that person’ , as you call , to Drenthe with me .
I couldn’t do that even if I wanted to , because I don’t have the money for it .
As to the money — brother — you understand that I don’t take any pleasure in it any more , don’t you? You do understand that , don’t you?
I did take pleasure in it because it meant not only my survival , but also that of those poor creatures .
It’s a sad letter at the end of this year — sad for me to write , sad for you to receive (although you’re at liberty to dismiss it , decide that for yourself) , but it’s worse for the poor . Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
I’ve had news from again , since I sent her to a doctor and have heard various details about it .
 
Further — brother — you know that my response was cool to the tidings that a calamity that threatened you has been averted , I have no other response in that regard than ‘too BAD for you — my friend’ . Perhaps you’ll understand why one day . I don’t say that it wouldn’t have been a calamity , but . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It seems to me that there are those moments in life when it’s better that the blow should fall , albeit it hard , than that one should be liable to be spared by the world . As to me , I’m bound to misfortune and failure , it’s damned hard sometimes , but there it is . I still don’t envy the so-called fortunate and eternally successful ones , since I see too much behind it . Take the Prisonnier by Gérôme — the man lying shackled is in a bad way to be sure , but in my view it’s better to be him than that other fellow who’s lording it over him and tormenting him . I say this to point out to you the extremes of circumstances . In no way do I , for example , confuse my own fate with more aggravated misery like that of the prisoner . Nevertheless , in our society one also sees a je ne sais quoi of what I refer to .
And for myself I do not congratulate you that it may be expected that you’ll be able to keep in with certain authorities . It occurred to me that it wouldn’t be superfluous to declare myself to you . You can take it just exactly as you like .
I don’t forget , either , that at the beginning you had compassion for the in question . But precisely because I myself was not and am not blind to her faults , but sought and seek her preservation despite them , I believe that you could have respected and better understood this feeling of mine — then you would also have been able to take my part more resolutely against anyone who knew less about it than you , and it wouldn’t have got to such a high pitch that I had to give it up .
I’m warning you now , because perhaps it’s still not too late ; if it gets any worse the time for warnings will be past .
 
If you need me to explain everything to you even more plainly , here you are . You say yourself that you wish I would leave the , yes , leave her completely .
Very well , but I won’t or can’t do it , do you understand , my friend , and it would be treachery if I were to do such a thing — I’m thinking of old words from the Bible , ‘hide not thy face from thy neighbour’ . Now I tell you outright , no Theo (if you choose to presume that I want to do this or that , think exactly what you like , I shall do what I shall do , D . V . ) .
I know very well that this is a sore point that relates to the financial aspect . Not only in the sense you refer to in your letter , but in the first place in another . If I accept money from you and do something you declare yourself to be directly opposed to , that would be wrong . I’ve always talked openly to you about everything , and revealed myself just as I was , tried to be honest , but I haven’t acted without consulting you . Very well , should this stop and should we not know each other in our private lives any more , there would be something false about our position . And that I decline .
I’ve spoken my mind about Pa , I’ve spoken my mind about you as far as this summer is concerned . Why? To convert you to my way of thinking? No , just because I would consider it treacherous of me if I were to keep such things to myself . I am simply not a traitor , and if I have something against someone , then I say so and I don’t fear the consequences , although they can be serious enough .
 
That’s simply the way I am — I clarify the position myself and say: hold on , because I think very differently from you about this and that , and I can’t associate with you with the old cordiality any more (I’m not saying that I don’t want to associate with Pa or you at all any more — I’m not such a zealot) .
But I feel it when something has been broken . And I say , what’s broken is broken .
If I do this , at least I’ll regain my serenity , I would lose my serenity if I wasn’t frank enough .
I dare to face the future provided — I don’t enter into things that I’d feel were dishonest .
And if you want yet another reason , well here you are then . For the sake of putting the back on her feet , I would even sacrifice my own pride over this principle or that as far as taking money is concerned , and did this more than once for her sake and for the children , but if the woman were not there then I would be even prouder than ever . (I already told you that in The Hague in response to something about being good friends with H . G . T . , when you said then , ‘yes , I thought as much’ . ) And now , in my view , the situation is such that I can do nothing for the woman in the circumstances if I have no support , from you for instance , and that consequently I think myself that it is not in my power to help her — at least not right away . So you have power over me — you , above all , in conjunction with many others , none of whom are able to agree with me . And yet you will not get me to renounce her — with all your financial power . And because I won’t give in on the issue of the woman and want to say that clearly , make it audible to even the deafest of ears , I declare in advance that I’ve decided to share with her that which is my property , and I don’t wish to accept any money from you except what I can regard as my property without second thoughts .
Vincent
 
Know , in short , that I believe I’m allowed to do anything that doesn’t harm anyone else , and that freedom , to which not just I but , in my view , every human being has the full , self-evident right — that freedom , I say , I have a duty to uphold as being the only position that I have to uphold . I really do ask: will I harm someone with this or that before I act? But unless people really prove to me that I would harm someone with something that I do , I don’t have to refrain from doing it .
  So , I who don’t coerce also don’t want to be coerced — I who respect others’ freedoms also insist on my own .
And as for the and the , she’s attached to me , and that even after the parting , and I to her . And now I should in some way undertake , tacitly or not tacitly , to abandon her? No , I won’t undertake any such thing . I’m not asking you to be responsible for any costs whatsoever ; on the contrary , I tell you , you can reduce the money , stop it altogether , but she’ll have her share of what I have .
True cowardice on my part , brother , would be to be ambiguous about this . If it had to come to it that I myself had nothing , very well — that would be the worst , and there would still perhaps be others besides you who would make my life possible , to some extent . And if not — well , then not .
