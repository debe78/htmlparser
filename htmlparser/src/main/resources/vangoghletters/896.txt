Letter|My dear Theo and dear Jo .
I’ve just received the letter in which you say that the is ill ; I’d very much like to come and see you , and what holds me back is the thought that I’d be even more powerless than you are in the given state of distress . But I can feel how very exhausting it must be , and would like to be able to lend a hand . By coming straightaway I fear I would increase the confusion . However , I share your anxieties with all my heart . It’s a real pity that at Mr Gachet’s the house is so cluttered with all sorts of things . Otherwise I think it would be a good plan to come and lodge here – at his house – with the little one , at least for a good month – I think that the country air has an enormous effect . In the street here there are kids born in Paris and really sickly – who however are well . Coming here to the inn would be possible too , it’s true . So that you aren’t too alone I could come myself to stay at your place for a week or fortnight .
That wouldn’t increase the expenses . For the little one , truly I’m beginning to fear that he must be given air , and especially the little bustle of the other children of a village . Surely , Jo too , who shares our anxieties and risks , I think that from time to time she must take this distraction of the country .
A rather melancholy letter from Gauguin , he talks vaguely of having definitely decided on Madagascar , but so vaguely that one can clearly see that he’s only thinking of it because he doesn’t really know what else to think about . And the execution of the plan seems almost absurd to me .

Here are three croquis – one of a figure of a peasant woman , big yellow hat with a knot of sky-blue ribbons , very red face . Coarse blue blouse with orange spots , background of ears of wheat .
It’s a no . 30 canvas but it’s really a little coarse , I fear . Then the horizontal landscape with the fields , a subject like one of Michel’s – but then the coloration is soft green , yellow and green-blue . Then undergrowth , violet trunks of poplars which cross the landscape perpendicularly like columns . The depths of the undergrowth are blue , and under the big trunks the flowery meadow , white , pink , yellow , green , long russet grasses and flowers .
The here at the inn used to live in Paris ; there they were constantly indisposed , parents and children , here they never have anything , and especially not the l one which came here when it was 2 months old , and then the mother had difficulty in suckling him , while here all of that went well almost immediately . In another respect you work all day long , and at the moment you’re probably hardly sleeping . I’d willingly believe that Jo would have twice as much milk here , and that then when she came here one could do without cows , donkeys and other quadrupeds . And as for Jo , so that during the daytime she has company , my word , she could also go and stay just opposite ère Gachet , perhaps you remember that there’s an inn just opposite at the bottom of the slope .
 
What do you want me to say as regards the future , perhaps , perhaps , without Boussods?
What will be , will be , you haven’t spared yourself trouble for them , you’ve served them with an exemplary fidelity all the time .
I , too , am trying to do as well as I can , but I don’t hide from you that I scarcely dare count on always having the necessary health .
And if my illness recurred you would excuse me , I still love art and life very much , but as to ever having a wife of my own I don’t believe in it very strongly . I fear , rather , that towards let’s say the age of forty – but let’s not say anything – I declare that I know nothing , absolutely nothing , of what turn it may yet take .
But I’m writing to you at once that as regards the one I think you mustn’t worry yourselves excessively ; if it’s that he’s teething , well to make the task easier for him perhaps we could distract him more here where there are children , animals , flowers and good air .
I shake your hand and Jo’s firmly in thought , and kiss the one .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Thank you for the consignment of colours , for the 50-franc note and for the article on the Independents .
An Englishman , Australian , called Walpole Brooke will probably come to see you ; he lives at 16 rue de la Grande Chaumière – I told him that you would let him know a time when he could come and see my canvases that are at your place .
He’ll probably show you some of his studies , which are still rather lifeless , but however he does observe nature . He has been here in Auvers for months , and we went out together sometimes , he was brought up in Japan , you would never think so from his painting – but that may come .
