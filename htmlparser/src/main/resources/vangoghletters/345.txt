Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Coming home just now I found your postcard , which was delivered this morning soon after I left — I see that , apart from your model this afternoon , you also had an appointment for this morning . And I’m sorry you didn’t tell me this — we could have gone there together if need be . For the rest , the pleasure of having seen your work is no small thing for me and I’m pleased to have visited you , if I haven’t upset your plans too much . It wasn’t my fault , though , for I hadn’t yet received your postcard , and have only just found it .
Your work , again , I think it very good — above all the sketch of the woman spinning , also very good — it’s the real thing . I wish you had a charcoal drawing of Tile painters as well , I suggest you consider doing one . Why? — because compositions like that most certainly also work well when painted , and are truer and raised to a higher level in some respects in that state .
 
Yet the Black and White or Light and Shade of it acquires a peculiar charm in itself and stands by itself — lending itself at the same time to possible reproduction , photos of Tile painters are bound to fail compared with the painting because of the blue coming out as white .
The heads (studies) of the blind men seem outstanding to me . Do you agree that we hereby more or less resolve to visit each other again , turn and turn about , before the end of the current year?
Here’s a passage from Dickens which I think says very expressively what a figure painter feels while working on a composition .
‘I was occupied with this Story during many workinghours of two years . I must have been very ill employed , if I could not leave its merits and demerits as a whole to express themselves — on its being read as a whole . But , as it isn’t unreasonable to suppose that I may have held its various threads with a more continuous attention than any one else can have given to them during its desultory publication , it isn’t unreasonable to ask that the weaving may be looked at in its complete state , and with the pattern finished . ’
Preface Little Dorrit .
 
Here you see , my dear friend , beautifully expressed , how a figure painter deserves to be regarded — as a whole .
Today I saw you in that way , and it has confirmed my sympathy for you .
For your part , continue to regard me as a whole too , which many others do not .
What I also think very good is that one sees books in your studio , Hugo , Zola , Dickens – figure painter books . Will send you Erckmann-Chatrian , Histoire d’un paysan to read .
The French Revolution — that is the centre — the constitution of 1789 the modern gospel , no less sublime than that of Year 1 .
And how one can be a figure painter and not feel anything of that I cannot understand — and find something empty in the studios of those kinds of figure painters if the modern writings are absent . And I believe that’s your impression too .
 
Do you know what I didn’t take? The miners’ strike by Roll , which I believe you have in duplicate . I have it myself but it was meant for Van der Weele , who , between you and me , badly needs to see some foreign compositions in my view , and is I think somewhat weighed down by Dutch prejudices — although in his large painting he wrests free of them .
As for printer’s ink , I wanted to say , try splashing and smearing with it — at random and from the imagination as it were — on a piece of paper or an old study , just for the effect . But gently — with turpentine — then I believe you’ll see things in it that will prove useful . Your study for which I posed looked very good when it was properly dry , but I believe it would have been even better if it had been prepared with charcoal . And try washing with a brush and water in a scratch done with lithographic crayon . If you take the trouble , you’ll certainly find things that are very useful and practical with the printer’s ink — probably more and better than I’ve found so far .
How beautiful those illustrations are by Lhermitte , Perret , Bastien-Lepage that you have! If I were you I’d do even more of those fine heads like the blind men . I’ll also try it out with a finer pencil — — adieu — with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
As to writers , don’t you agree that one doesn’t know writers like Dickens , Balzac , Hugo , Zola until one has more or less full knowledge of their work? I think that the same applies to Michelet and Erckmann-Chatrian too .
 
I refuse to accept that a painter may or must do nothing but paint . I mean that while many regard , for instance , reading books or something else as what they’d call a waste of time , it seems to me on the contrary that — far from working less or less well if one attempts to learn about another area that’s nonetheless directly related — one works more and better as a result — and at any rate the point of view from which one sees things and one’s approach to life is a matter of importance and a great influence on the work .
The more one loves , the more one will act , I believe , for love that is only a feeling I wouldn’t even consider to be love .
Well , I hope this consignment of wood engravings will be to your taste . Return the ones you already have together with the others when it’s convenient , then I’ll give them to Van der Weele . I’ve sorted them out as carefully as possible — and as far as I can make out these are all the duplicates . There are a few French ones among them too .
We can check the rest when you come , sooner or later .
Then you’ll certainly have a lot more prints to look at which , sadly , I don’t have in duplicate .
Enjoy them — and write again soon .
