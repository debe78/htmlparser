your sunflowers on a yellow background which I regard as a perfect page of an essential ‘Vincent’ style . At your brother’s home I saw your Sower , which is very good , as well as a yellow still life , apples and lemons . Your brother gave me a lithographed reproduction of an old painting of yours , Dutch – very interesting as regards colour in the drawing . In my studio next to your portrait .
The grape harvests are totally covered in scales as a result of the white which has separated . I’ve stuck all of it back down using
  a process shown to me by the reliner . If I tell you about it it’s because the thing is easy to do and can be very good for those of your canvases that need retouching – you stick newspapers on your canvas with flour paste . Once dry , you put your canvas on a smooth board and with very hot irons you press down hard on it . All the breaks in your colour will remain but will be flattened down and you’ll have a very fine surface . Afterwards you soak your paper covering well and take off all the paper .
That’s largely the whole secret of relining .
 
Thank Roulin for thinking of me . I have indeed received my stretcher keys – at the next opportunity if you can send me by parcel post my 2 fencing masks and gloves , which I left on the shelf in the little upstairs room .
Friendly wishes from me to everyone .
Cordially yours ,
Paul Gauguin
