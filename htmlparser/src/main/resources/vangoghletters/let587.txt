Letter|My dear Bernard ,
Having promised to write to you , I want to begin by telling you that this part of the world seems to me as beautiful as Japan for the clearness of the atmosphere and the gay colour effects . The stretches of water make patches of a beautiful emerald and a rich blue in the landscapes , as we see it in the Japanese prints . Pale orange sunsets making the fields look blue — glorious yellow suns . However , so far I’ve hardly seen this part of the world in its usual summer splendour . The women’s costume is pretty , and especially on the boulevard on Sunday you see some very naive and well-chosen arrangements of colour . And that , too , will doubtless get even livelier in summer .
 
I regret that living here isn’t as cheap as I’d hoped , and until now I haven’t found a way of getting by as easily as one could do in Pont-Aven . I started out paying 5 francs and now I’m on 4 francs a day . One would need to know the local patois , and know how to eat bouillabaisse and aïoli , then one would surely find an inexpensive family boarding-house . Then if there were several of us , I’m inclined to believe we’d get more favourable terms . Perhaps there’d be a real advantage in emigrating to the south for many artists in love with sunshine and colour . The Japanese may not be making progress in their country , but there’s no doubt that their art is being carried on in France . At the top of this letter I’m sending you a little croquis of a study that’s preoccupying me as to how to make something of it — sailors coming back with their sweethearts towards the town , which projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun .
I have another study of the same drawbridge with a group of washerwomen . Shall be happy to have a line from you to know what you’re doing and where you’re going to go . A very warm handshake to you and the friends .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
