Letter|Amsterdam , 12 June 1877
My dear Theo ,
I received your letter of 7 June and was glad to see that you were in Etten and had a good Sunday there , it’s nice that Pa and brother brought you as far as Dordrecht .
And then you wrote about how you spoke at home of your plans for the future , when I read it , my heart spilled over for you , as it were , it seems very good to me . Launch out into the deep . What I hope now is only this – that you go to London before you see Paris . But we have to wait and see what happens . I’ve loved so much about those two cities , I think back on them with a feeling of nostalgia , and I’d almost like to go with you , if I’m ever far enough along to be permitted to fill a position in that great Dutch Church , then those memories will one day provide subjects for sermons , go onward in belief and with the faith of old , you and I ; who knows whether we’ll shake each other’s hand again as I remember Pa and Uncle Jan doing at that little church in Zundert , once when Uncle came back from travelling and much had happened in both their lives , and they now felt firm ground beneath their feet , as it were .
Be sure and write as soon as you hear any more about this , I hope that we’ll have a quiet moment together sometime before you leave . Even though there seems to be no opportunity at present , such a thing may soon come about . But I repeat , brother , my heart spills over for you , I think the plan is very good – my past comes completely alive again now that I’m thinking of your future . ‘Behold , I make all things new’ will perhaps soon be your experience .
Be blessed these days . Take a good look at the things around you – don’t forget them – walk through the land again , as it says: in the length of it and in the breadth of it .
I have a lot to do every day , so the time goes quickly and the days are almost too short , even though I stretch them out a bit , I have such a great desire to progress and also to know the Bible well and thoroughly , and also to know many things , such as what I wrote to you about Cromwell . ‘No day without a line’ , daily writing , reading , working and practising , with meekness and perseverance , will surely lead to something .
 
This week I went to the cemetery here , outside the Muiderpoort , there’s a small wood in front of it where it’s beautiful , especially in the evening when the sun shines through the leaves , there are also a lot of beautiful graves and all kinds of evergreens , and roses and forget-me-nots bloom there . Also took another walk to the Zuiderzee , which is 40 minutes from here , over a dyke from which one sees meadows everywhere and farms which always remind me of etchings by Rembrandt . It’s a beautiful city , this , today I again saw a corner for Thijs Maris or Allebé , namely houses behind the Oosterkerk , on a small inner courtyard , I had to see the to ask about Uncle’s place in the church and I was in his house , also living there is a shoemaker &amp ; c . , but one finds it everywhere , the world is full of it , may our own heart be filled with it and become so more and more . When I saw that sexton I couldn’t help thinking of a wood engraving , by Rethel I think , you must know it too , ‘Death as a friend’ . I always found that scene very moving , in London in those days one saw it in front of nearly all the print-shop windows . It has a pendant , Cholera in Paris , and that dance of death is also by Rethel .
Heard the Rev . Laurillard on Sunday morning in the early sermon on ‘Jesus went through the cornfields’ . He made a deep impression on me – he also spoke in that sermon about the parable of the sower and about the man who cast seed into the ground , and he should sleep , and rise day and night , and the seed should spring and increase and grow up , he knoweth not how , he also spoke about the funeral in the cornfield by Van der Maaten . The sun shone through the windows – there weren’t that many people in the church , mostly labourers and women . Afterwards I heard Uncle Stricker in the Oosterkerk on ‘praise , not of men but of God’ , also occasioned by the death of H . M .
On Monday Aunt Mina and Margreet Meyboom left for Etten , and I saw them at the station of the Oosterspoor . While I was waiting for them there , I read the following in Lamennais
At the head of a small inlet beneath a cliff hollowed out at its foot by the waves , among rocks from which hung long strands of sea-green weed , two men , one young , the other old but still sturdy , leaning against a fishing-boat , waited for the tide that was slowly coming in , barely ruffled by a dying breeze . Swelling as they neared the shore , the waves slid lazily over the sand with a faint and gentle murmur . A little later , the boat could be seen moving away from the shore towards the open sea , its prow raised , leaving behind it a ribbon of white foam . The old man , beside the tiller , watched the sails as they filled , then drooped like weary wings . His gaze then seemed to look for a sign on the horizon and in the dense , motionless clouds . Then , as he sank back into his thoughts , one read on his tanned brow an entire life of toil and unremitting struggle from which he had never flinched . The ebb tide created small valleys in the calm sea , where the hen petrel played , balancing gracefully on the glistening , lead-hued waves . From high in the air the seagull dived into them like an arrow , and on the black tip of a rock the ungainly cormorant stood motionless . The slightest movement , a faint breath of air ,
  a streak of light , altered the aspect of these changing scenes . The young man , withdrawn into himself , saw them as one sees in dreams . His soul drifted and floated to the sound of the wake , like the light , monotonous sound with which the nurse sends the child to sleep . Suddenly , coming out of his reverie , his eyes light up , the air echoes to the sound of his resonant voice: To the ploughman the fields , to the huntsman the woods , to the fisherman the sea and its waves , and its reefs and its storms . The sky above his head , the depths beneath his feet , he is free , he has no master but himself . See her obey his hand , see her leap across the moving plains , the frail vessel into which the wind breathes life . He contends with the waves and subdues them , he contends with the wind and tames it . Who is as strong , who is as great as he? Where are the boundaries of his domains? Has anyone ever found them? Wherever the Ocean pours itself forth , God has said to him: Go , this is thine . His nets gather a living harvest in the depths of the waters . He has flocks beyond number which grow fat for him in pastures covered by the seas . Flowers — purple , blue , yellow , crimson , open in their bosom , and to charm his eye , the clouds present him with vast shores , beautiful azure lakes , wide rivers , mountains and valleys and fantastic cities , now plunged in shadow , now lit by all the glory of the setting sun . Oh , how sweet it is to me , the fisherman’s life! How its harsh battles and its manly joys delight me . And yet , my mother , when at night the squall suddenly shakes our cabin , what fear grips your heart! See you rise , all trembling , to invoke the holy Virgin who protects poor sailors! Kneeling before her image , your tears flow for your son , driven in the darkness by the whirlwind towards the reefs , where the moans of the dead are heard , mingling with the voice of the storm . Protect us , O Lord , for our barks are so small and Thy sea is so great .
A terrible storm blew up here this morning at quarter to 5 , a little while later the first stream of workers came through the gate of the dockyard in the pouring rain . Got up and went into the yard and took a couple of notebooks to the cupola and sat there reading and looking round the whole yard and dock , the poplars and elders and other shrubs were bent by the strong wind , and the rain pelted on the wood-piles and the decks of the ships , sloops and a little steamboat went back and forth in the distance , near the village on the other side of the IJ , one saw brown sails passing quickly and the houses and trees on Buitenkant and churches in more vivid colours . Again and again one heard thunder and saw lightning , the sky looked like a painting by Ruisdael , and the gulls were flying low over the water .
It was a magnificent sight , and really refreshing after the oppressive heat of yesterday . It has refreshed me , because I was awfully tired when I went upstairs yesterday evening .
Paid a visit yesterday to the Rev . Meijjes and his wife , because Pa had told me to do this , and I had tea with them . When I arrived , His Reverence was taking his afternoon nap and I was requested to go for a half-hour walk , which I did , fortunately I had that little book by Lamennais in my pocket and I read under the trees lining the canals , where the evening sun was reflected in the dark water . Then I went back , and they made me think of ‘Winter’ by Thorvaldsen . One nevertheless sees it much more beautifully in Pa and Ma , but as I said , it was like that here , too .
 
The days fly past , I’m four years older than you and I feel that they probably go by faster for me than for you , but I fight against it by stretching them out a bit in the mornings and evenings .
Will you write again soon? It’s a pity that Mager isn’t coming after all . The weather has cleared up again , and the sky is blue and the sun is shining brightly and the birds are singing , there are rather a lot of them at the yard , and all kinds , in the evenings I always walk up and down there with the dog , often thinking of that poem ‘Under the stars’ .
When all sounds cease , God’s voice is heard , under the stars .
The roses growing against the house are also blooming , and in the garden the elderberry and jasmine . Recently went to the Trippenhuis again to see whether those rooms , which were closed when we were there together , had been put back in order , but it will probably take another fortnight before one can go in again . There were a lot of foreigners at the time , French and English , hearing them speak revives a lot of memories in me . Yet I don’t regret being back here . ‘Life hath quicksands , life hath snares’ are true words .
How is Mrs Tersteeg? If you run into Mauve or go to see him , give him my regards , also to everyone at Haanebeeks’ and Rooses’ .
Now I must get to work , don’t have any lessons today , but on the other hand 2 hours tomorrow morning , so have really a lot to do . I’ve worked my way through the history of the Old Testament up to Samuel , this evening I’ll start with Kings , when that work is finished , it will be a valuable thing to have . As I sit here writing I cannot help making a little drawing now and then , like the one I sent you recently , and like the one I made this morning of Elijah in the desert with stormy skies and a couple of thorn-bushes in the foreground , it’s nothing special , but sometimes I see it all so clearly in my mind’s eye , and I believe that at such moments I should be able to talk about it passionately , may it later be granted me to do so .
I wish you the very best , if you ever go to the Scheveningen Bosjes or to the beach , give them my regards . When you next come here I’ll be able to show you some beautiful spots here as well . Every day on my way to Mendes I have to pass through the Jewish quarter .
Should like you to hear the Rev . Laurillard too , one day .
And now , adieu , a handshake in thought from
Your loving brother ,
Vincent
