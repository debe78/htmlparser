Letter|My dear Theo ,
It’s New Year’s Eve and I feel so much like having another word with you . When I wrote my last letter I spoke to you about large heads that I was working on . I was carrying out an experiment at the time , the first results of which I can now report to you , since the day before yesterday , yesterday and today I’ve had models for two drawings .
When I made the lithographs , I was struck by the fact that the lithographic crayon was very pleasant to work with , and I thought of making drawings with it .
It has one drawback , though , which you’ll understand — it’s greasy , so one can’t rub it out in the normal way . Working with it on paper , one mostly has to do without the only thing that one can use to erase on the stone itself , namely the scraper , which can’t be used with enough force on the paper because it goes through it .
But I had the idea of first doing a drawing in carpenter’s pencil and then working in and over it with lithographic crayon , because (owing to the greasiness of the material) it takes on pencil , whereas ordinary crayon does not , or only poorly . Having done the sketch in this way , one can confidently work in the lithographic crayon where necessary without having to search or rub out a lot . So I went quite a long way towards finishing my drawings in pencil , as far in fact as I possibly could with it . Then I fixed them and made them matt with milk . And then drew over them again in lithographic crayon , where the greatest strengths were , reinforcing them here and there with a brush or pen with lampblack , and working with white body-colour in the light passages .
 
Now I have a drawing of an old man sitting reading done in this way , with light that falls on the bald head , the hand and the book .
And a second one , a head of an injured man with a bandage .
The model I had for that one really did have an injury to his head and a bandage on his left eye . Just like the head of a soldier of the old guard in the retreat from Russia , say .
When I compare these two heads with the others I’ve done , there’s a big difference in the strength of the effect .
So I have hopes that drawings done in this way will be suitable for reproduction using the process you’ve described to me .
Especially if the paper you sent isn’t absolutely essential for reproduction .
And if it’s essential , then I believe that I would sooner get a better effect than a worse one with the same ingredients on the grey paper . When I looked at what Buhot had scratched on the one sample , I saw right away that the black was of a very deep tone , and I can understand that this is really essential for reproduction , where photogravure and galvanoplasty are involved .
 
So I immediately tried to see which black I could use , while still sketching in my normal way .
I tried ink first , but I wasn’t satisfied with that , although I believe that in that way the effects will be better with lithographic crayon .
Well , I’m not writing about this in order to bother you in the midst of your busy days . I’m not in a hurry , and in fact it would be very welcome if I have some more time to investigate further .
But I’m writing this to you so that you’ll know that I’m toiling away heart and soul to get it good and usable .
What people call Black and White is actually Painting in black . Painting in the sense that one puts into a drawing the depth of effect and the rich gradations of tone that a painting should have . You rightly said not long ago that every colourist has an individual colour spectrum .
This is also the case with Black and White . Yet fundamentally it’s one and the same . One must be able to go from the highest lights to the deepest shadows , and do so with a few simple ingredients .
Some draughtsmen have a nervous manner that gives their technique something of the singularity of the sound a violin makes , such as Lemud , Daumier , Lançon . Others , like Gavarni and Bodmer , are more reminiscent of the piano . Is this how it seems to you? Millet is perhaps a solemn organ .
 
2 January
That’s as far as I got on New Year’s Eve , I was hoping your letter would have arrived . If you haven’t yet written , please do so , for I have nothing left . But you must be very busy . I’ve now done some more sketches in lithographic crayon . It’s almost as nice to work with as paint , and one can get a great strength and depth of black with it . I’m really yearning to speak to you again , I have so many plans — not all of which will be implemented , but not all of which will fail either . And with respect to them , I really have so little time to think things through and I have too little idea of how things stand to be able to decide on their feasibility myself , so I greatly need to discuss them with you . Above all , don’t be concerned that I haven’t yet done anything saleable this year — you’ve sometimes said that to me yourself , and if I now say it I do so because I see a few things being attainable in future which I didn’t see before . I sometimes think back to a few years ago when I came to this city . I imagined that the painters here would form a sort of circle or society in which warmth and open-heartedness and a certain unity would prevail . To me this was in the nature of things , and I didn’t know that it could be different .
I wouldn’t like to give up the ideas about this that I had when I came here , even if I have to modify them and make a distinction between what is and what could be . I can’t believe that it’s a natural state of affairs to have so much coolness and discord . What is the cause??? I don’t know , and I’m not called on to investigate this , but I for one make it my principle not to do two things . The first is that one shouldn’t get into disputes ; instead one should try to foster peace , both for others and for oneself . And the other thing one shouldn’t do , in my opinion , is try to be something in society other than a painter if one is a painter . As a painter , one must leave aside other social ambitions and not produce the same thing as the fellows who live in Voorhout and Willemspark &amp ; c . For in the old , smoke-stained , dark studios there was an intimacy and something real that was infinitely better than what’s threatening to take its place .
Should you see progress in my work when you come again , then I would like to be able to continue in the same way as hitherto . Namely , that I can quietly
  carry on working without bothering about other people . As long as there’s bread in the house and I have a little in my pocket to pay for models , what more could I want? My enjoyment lies in my work getting better — and that absorbs me more and more . Now , old chap , if you haven’t yet written , write soon . I’m rather hard up .
Again , my best wishes for the New Year .
  I received a good letter from home .
Adieu , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
