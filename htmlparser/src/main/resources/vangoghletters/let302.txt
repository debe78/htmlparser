Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Are you continuing to make a good recovery? I do so long to have news of you . I recently bought 21 volumes of The Graphic , namely 1870-1880 . What do you say about that? I’ll receive them this week , I hope . I got them very cheaply , you understand , otherwise I couldn’t have managed it . But I heard that they were for sale and got someone else interested who also appreciates them .
Since your illness I’ve been working hard on Black and White drawings , and I hope to learn a thing or two from these Graphics about the strengths of black and white . I wish we could talk to each other again , because , old chap , what a lot there still is to do!
What I’ve been toiling at in particular lately is heads — Heads of the people — including fishermen’s heads with sou’westers .
When I’ve looked through The Graphics I’ll write to you about them at greater length . Of course I’m bound to have many duplicates .
 
Now I’ll be pleased to hear more about the batch that you bought , not just whether or not there are duplicates but also in general what interesting prints you find .
I found a girl’s head by Percy Macquoid that’s wonderfully fine , a woodcut after a painting by him . Other fine prints I’ve found since include
B . Constant	Sick fellahs beside the Nile
Julien Dupré	Herdswoman
Smith	A street in South Lambeth
Ridley	Boat race
Robinson
Green	Street in Whitechapel
Régamey	Prison in New York
Thulstrup	Workroom in Sailors hospital or home
Abbey	Winter girl
, ,              
Peter Stuyvesandt
Reinhart Fishermen
Barnard	sheets
Ed . Frère	Wood gatherers
Buckman	on Hampstead Heath
, ,              
Gathering poppies
Walker	Tip girls (Miners)
 
I had to go to some trouble to get The Graphic . For example , I had to do two portraits (two of each!) of the father and mother of the Jew I bought them from . But isn’t it a lucky find!
But it’s so odd that they’re already my property and yet I still haven’t seen them . They’re stored with another large batch of books in a saleroom , but the Jew will get them out this week .
Among the books is La mascarade humaine , 100 lithographs by Gavarni . I have them but do you? And the Jew has other things as well that are probably good .
Well , more soon . I hope you make a good recovery , in haste .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
