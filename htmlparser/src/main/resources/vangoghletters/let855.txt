Letter|Dear Mother ,
I’ve been meaning to answer your letter for days , but didn’t get round to writing because I was painting from morning till night , and so the time passed . I imagine that your thoughts , like mine , are with Jo and Theo . How glad I was when the news came that it had gone well ; very good thing Wil stayed . I’d much rather that he’d called his boy after Pa , whom I’ve thought about so often these days , than after me , but anyway , as it’s been done now I started right away to make a painting for him , to hang in their bedroom . Large branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky .
I thank you for the news about Cor . You won’t forget to send him my regards when you write , will you? What you write about Aunt Mina , that she bears her pain with so much patience , touched me . You must be back in Leiden again by now . The last few days we’ve had rather miserable weather here , but today it was a real spring day , and the fields of young wheat and the lilac hills in the distance so beautiful , and the almond trees are beginning to blossom everywhere . I was really rather surprised at that article they wrote about me — Isaäcson wanted to do it some time ago and I asked him not to put pen to paper ; I was saddened by it when I read it because it’s so exaggerated ; it’s not like that — precisely what sustains me in my work is the feeling that there are several people who are doing exactly the same as I , and so why an article about me and not about those 6 or 7 others etc . ?
 
Now I must confess that later , when my surprise had abated somewhat , I felt very heartened by it at times ; yesterday , what’s more , Theo informed me that they’d sold one of my paintings in Brussels for 400 francs . In comparison with other prices , including the Dutch ones , this isn’t much , but that’s why I try to be productive in order to be able to keep working at reasonable prices . And if we have to try to earn our living with our hands , I have an awful lot of expenses to make up for .
The letter from Wil and you just arrived , thank you very much for it . I should have written to you before but , as I said , my mind wasn’t on writing because I was so busy working .
Now I’m seriously thinking of profiting from that windfall of selling that painting to go to Paris — to visit Theo . And thanks to the here I feel I’ll leave calmer and healthier than I came here . Just to see how it goes outside an asylum is perhaps only a matter of course . The work may possibly be more difficult for me , though , when I’m at liberty again .
Anyway , we’ll hope for the best . It’s odd that my with whom I worked for a time in Arles should want to go to Antwerp , and that way I’d be a little closer to you all again . But I’m afraid this isn’t entirely practicable , partly because I think it would be more expensive , and if one’s accustomed to the climate here it might also be bad for one’s health to return further north . Anyway , I’ll start by trying a week or so in Paris . Embraced in thought by your loving
Vincent .
