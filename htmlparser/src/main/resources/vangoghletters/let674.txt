Letter|My dear Theo
I write to you while waiting for Boch , the Belgian , who’s leaving early this morning . He’s already 33 years old , including 10 years of Paris and travels . His is even older than he is . Although until now he hasn’t been anything very much as a painter yet , if by returning to his country he can at last shake off his idleness , caused by the enervation in Paris , and by keeping company with idlers , then he’ll find himself on the very threshold of a career as a true painter .
He’s very much of his country , because in his speech and in his manners I recognized very clearly the accent of his country , the timidity of those miners , whom I still think about so often . You’ll probably see his two paintings that he’s bringing ; the drawing in them is poor , but the colour is already beginning to be lively . His will perhaps make a tour in Holland , and I’ve thought in a vague way that I’d really like it if our own and she were to meet . I always have hopes that through us , Wil may be able to marry an artist . Now to bring that about she’d have to be a little bit up to date . If Boch’s sister actually goes to Holland , we’d only have to say to Boch that if she wants to study in Breda , she can stay with our and our sister .
 
That’ll put them to some very small expenses at home (they put up enough useless people) , but after all , it would be an opportunity to become acquainted . But let’s not press the point .
But at the Bochs’ home , it’s a household of painters ; the two children being in the profession , with that they’re not penniless .
Now I sent you an order for colours exactly a week ago . And a letter for Tasset , asking him if he could supply coarsely ground colours more cheaply . At this very moment I’m almost at the end of my supply of colours — altogether I’ve about a dozen and a half different tubes left . So it’s necessary for me to replace the order in question with another . Which you’ll find attached .
If Tasset couldn’t do colours more cheaply , you’d have to send double tubes as usual , but I’d need twice as many tubes of that size . Until I have them I’ll have to draw , because I’ve run out as far as colours are concerned .
 
Neither Gauguin nor Bernard has written to me again . I believe that Gauguin doesn’t give a damn , seeing that it isn’t happening right away , and for my part , seeing that Gauguin has been managing anyway for 6 months , I’m ceasing to believe in the urgent need to come to his assistance .
Now let’s be careful about it . If it doesn’t suit him , he could reproach me: ‘why have you made me come to this filthy part of the country?’
And I don’t want any of that .
Of course , we can remain friends with Gauguin all the same , but I see all too clearly that his attention is elsewhere .
I say to myself , let’s behave as if he wasn’t there , then if he comes , so much the better , if he doesn’t come , too bad .
How I’d like to set myself up so that I could have a home of my own! I never stop telling myself that if at the start we’d
  spent even 500 francs on furnishing , we would already have recouped all of it , and I would have furniture and I would be free of lodging-house keepers by now . I’m not pressing the point , but what we’re doing now isn’t wise . There will always be artists passing through here , wishing to escape the harshness of the north . And I feel myself that I’ll always be among that number . True that it would probably be better to go a bit further down , where you’d be more sheltered . True that it won’t be entirely easy to find , but all the more reason ; if we set ourselves up here , the costs of moving shouldn’t be enormous . From here to Bordighera , for example , or somewhere near Nice . Once we’d settled , we’d stay there for the rest of our lives . Waiting until you’re very rich is a sorry system , and that’s what I don’t like about the De Goncourt , although it’s the truth — they end up paying a hundred thousand francs for their home and their peace of mind . Now we’d have it for less than a thousand , in that we’d have a studio in the south where we could put someone up .
 
But if we have to make a fortune first . . . . . . . . . we’ll be totally neurotic by the time we reach that sort of tranquillity , and that’s worse than our present state , in which we can still stand all sorts of noises . But let’s be wise enough to know that we’re getting dull-witted all the same .
It’s better to lodge others than not to be lodged ourselves here , especially lodging with an innkeeper , which even when you pay doesn’t provide you with a lodging where you feel at home .
As for Gauguin , he’s perhaps letting himself drift with the current without thinking about the future , it’s likely . And perhaps he’s saying that I’ll always be there , and that he has our word .
But there’s still time to take it back , and truly I feel very tempted to do so , because failing him , I would of course think about another partnership . Whereas at present we’re held to it . If Gauguin finds enough to live on as it is , have we the right to bother him? I’m avoiding writing to Gauguin for fear of saying too bluntly , look , for many months now we’ve been finding enough to live with lodging-house keepers , but claiming that we can’t join together , while at the same time even wearing ourselves out for the future .
  If you’d wished , why didn’t you tell me to come to the north? I’d have done it by now .
It would have cost a mere hundred-franc note , whereas today , during these months that it’s been dragging on , I’ve already paid that same note to my lodging-house keeper , and you must have done the same with yours , or you’ve gone into debt for 100 francs . Which by now makes at least 100 francs pure waste for absolutely nothing .
That’s what rankles with me , and what makes me say that both he and I are behaving like madmen at the moment . Is that true or not? In fact , the truth is even more serious . If he’s not in need of changing his way of life , he’s either much richer than me or he has considerably better luck . Ruining oneself costs more than succeeding , and it’s certainly our fault if we haven’t more peace .
Handshake and more soon , because I really hope that you’ll still find time to tell me more about our ’s stay with you .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Boch will probably be with you in a week or ten days .
Including the sunflowers , I still have about fifteen new studies here at the moment .
