My dear Vincent,
Excuse not answering your letter of some week or two ago. I’ve been much worried by the changing to this island. Packing up and other things.
It is most good of you to give Monsieur Gauguin a leg up. Not knowing the man I can’t say if he deserves it. I hope so for your sake.
  I would like to help you. But how? There is but one legitimate way. i.e. By purchasing one of his works. The very last day in Paris I tried to fetch Boussod; Valadon &amp; Cie to see the picture you speak of, ‘niggers &amp;c.’, but failed through want of time. For others I saw, that big one of yours unfortunately swamps them in my opinion. So I am in a fix.
 
Young Bernard writes me from Saint-Briac.
Complains much of the weather interfering with his work.
Before I left Paris I lunched with Mr Rodin (who has finished a fine head of my ) and Mr Claude Monet. Saw ten of Mr Monet’s pictures done at Antibes. Very fine in color and light and a certain richness of envelop. But like nearly all the so-called Impressionist work the form is not enough
  studied. The big mass of form I mean. The trees too much wood in Branches for the size of Trunk and so against fundamental law of nature. A lack of construction everywhere.
He is undoubtedly a remarkable colorist. and full of courage in attacking difficult problems. We should all do the same. It is the only way to get strong. Luckily here in Belle-Île I am forced to try all things — figures, landscape, sea, cattle &amp;c. &amp;c. otherwise would
