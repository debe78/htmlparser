Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
All that has passed means that when I come to write to you it’s more in order to be clear than because I do it for my pleasure . As to my having returned your last letter to you forthwith , there were two reasons for it , each in its own right , to my mind , providing a motive . Firstly — suppose that your comments on the lithograph I sent you were correct , suppose I had nothing to say against them — even then , you wouldn’t have been justified in condemning my work in such an insulting manner , or rather in ignoring it as you did .
And secondly — whereas you have had more friendship than you have given , not just from me but from my family too , you certainly cannot claim that on an occasion such as my ’s death we were obliged to send something other than a printed notice .
Particularly not me , since before that time you hadn’t replied to a letter from me . Particularly not me , since on the occasion of my father’s death you did send an expression of sympathy in a letter addressed to my — but such a one that when it arrived there was comment at home about what reason there might be for not writing to me then — which I didn’t want , however , nor do I .
 
You know — I haven’t been on the best of terms with them at home for years . In the first few days after my died , I had to correspond with the immediate family . But otherwise , as soon as family arrived , I withdrew from it all completely . And regarding any omissions , not me but the family . And I have to tell you that in so far as it goes , you’re an exception , that I asked them at home if they’d sent you word and it appeared that it had been forgotten . Much more than enough about that .
The reason I’m writing to you again is in no way to respond to your comment in that regard . Nor to repeat what I said about your remarks about painting . You’ve been able to re-read your own letter . If you still believe that was justified , if you still really think that ‘if you put your mind to it , you can deuced well express yourself correctly’ — well — then it’s best simply to leave you to your delusions .
To get to the point — the reason why I’m writing to you is simply that — although it was you who insulted me in the first place , not I you — I’ve known you too long for me to consider this a reason
  to break off all acquaintance . What I have to say to you is as a painter to a painter and — so long as you and I paint — it will remain so — whether we know each other , whether we don’t . There was mention of Millet .
Very well — I’ll answer you , my dear friend .
You wrote , ‘you dare to invoke Millet and Breton’ .
My reply to that is that I seriously invite you to consider — simply not to fight with me . For my part — I go my own way — you see — but I don’t seek a quarrel with anyone — not with you now either . I’d also let you say anything that you wanted — if you had any more such expressions — and it would just be like water off a duck’s back . So much for the present , though . That I don’t care about the form of the figure , which you’ve said before — it’s beneath me to take any notice of it and — old chap — it’s beneath you to say something so unfounded . You’ve known me for years now — have you ever seen me do anything other than work from the model and resign myself to the sometimes great expense of it , even though I’m poor enough as it is?
 
What you didn’t write in your last , but did repeatedly and ad nauseam in previous letters , and was the reason for the letter to which you didn’t reply , is about ‘technique’ . What I replied to you then and reply once more is — the conventional meaning that people increasingly give to the word technique , and the actual meaning , knowledge . Well then . Meissonier himself says ,
‘the knowledge — nobody has it’ .
Well , ‘the knowledge’ isn’t the same as ‘knowledge’ , that first of all , and that you won’t deny . But even that still isn’t it .
Take Haverman , for instance ; people — you too — say of him that he has so much technique . But not only Haverman , how many others — have something that’s equivalent to the sort of knowledge that H . has of art — among the French painters — Jacquet , say , and he’s better .
My assertion is simply this — that drawing a figure academically correctly — that an even , reasoned brushstroke have little — at least less than is generally thought — to do with the needs — the urgent needs — of the present day in the field of painting .
If , instead of saying H . has a lot of ‘technique’ , you were to say H . has a lot of ‘craftsmanship’ , I would have agreed with you for once . You will perhaps understand what I mean when I say that when Haverman sits in front of the head of a beautiful girl/woman , he’ll make it more beautiful than almost anyone , but put him in front of a peasant — and — he won’t even make a start on it . His art — as far as I know — proves chiefly applicable to subjects which aren’t the ones that are needed — is above all applicable to subjects that are pretty much completely and utterly opposite to Millet or Lhermitte — and sooner run parallel to Cabanel — who for all his what I call — craftsmanship — has said little that lasted — or contributed to progress . And — this I beg of you — don’t confuse this with the way a Millet or Lhermitte paints .
What I said and still say — the word — technique — is all too often used in a conventional sense — and — it’s all too often not used in good faith . People praise the technique of all those Italians and Spaniards , and they’re fellows who are more conventional , have more sheer routine — than anyone else . And with such as Haverman , I fear , ‘craftsmanship’ so soon becomes — ‘routine’ . And then — what’s it worth then?
 
What I want to ask now — what’s the real reason that you’ve broken with me —?
The reason I’m writing to you again is just out of love for Millet , for Breton and for everyone who paints the peasants and the people , among whom I count you . I don’t say it because I got a lot from you as a friend – my dear friend – because — I got precious little from you — and don’t take it amiss of me for saying this to you straight out for the first and last time — I know of no drier friendship than yours . But — firstly that’s not why I’m doing it — secondly , that might have improved too — but having created my own opportunities to find models &amp ; c . , I’m not so petty as to keep it quiet . On the contrary — were any painter , no matter who , to come to this district , I would be glad both to invite him home and to show him the way . Precisely because it’s not always easy to find models who are willing to pose — and having a pied-à-terre somewhere isn’t a matter of indifference to everyone .
And this is why I say to you that , if you want to paint here , you mustn’t be embarrassed because we had a disagreement . And — although I’m living on my own in my studio now — you can even stay too .
 
It may be , though , that — superciliously — you’ll say that this is of no consequence to you . Well , that’s all right . I’m so accustomed to insults that they really are so like water off a duck’s back — that — someone like you — probably finds it hard to understand just how cold a letter like yours , say , leaves me . And being indifferent to it — I have no more resentment than a post . But I do have — enough clarity and serenity to reply as I do now .
If you want to break with me — very well .
If you want to go on painting here — you don’t have to take any notice of this little bit of bickering in our correspondence .
What you did the last time you were here — had and has my full sympathy — and — my dear friend Rappard — it’s because you worked so damned well that last time , and I think to myself that you might perhaps want things here to remain as they were , that I’m writing to you .
 
Make up your own mind — I say frankly — from one point of view — in spite of all my appreciation of your painting — I have some concerns about whether you’ll be able to keep it up like this later — I sometimes fear that , because of the influences to which you cannot but be exposed given your social position and standing , you may not remain as good in the long run as you are at the moment — just as a painter in your painting — I don’t concern myself with the rest .
So I say to you , as a painter to a painter , that if you want to look for paintings here , it will stay just the same as before . You can come here and , although I live on my own , stay just the same as before . You see — I thought that perhaps you had got and could get something out of it , and I just wanted to tell you this . If you can get on as well elsewhere — well then — I’ll have no reason to grieve about it , and then , adieu .
 
You’ve told me nothing about your work , so I likewise say nothing about mine .
Believe me — don’t argue with me about Millet — Millet is someone I won’t argue about , although I don’t refuse to talk about him .
Regards .
Vincent
