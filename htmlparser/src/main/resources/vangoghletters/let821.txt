St-Rémy in Provence
Sir,
I accept with pleasure your invitation to exhibit with the Vingtistes. Here is the list of canvases I intend for you
No 	 	Sunflowers
 	Sunflowers
 	The ivy
 	Orchard in blossom (Arles)
 	Wheatfield. Rising sun (St-Rémy)
 	The red vineyard (Montmajour)
(All these canvases are no. 30 canvases.)
I am perhaps exceeding the 4 metres of room but as I believe that the 6 together, thus chosen, will make a rather varied colour effect, perhaps you will find a way of placing them.
Please accept the expression of my entire fellow-feeling for the Vingtistes.
Vincent van Gogh
