Letter|My dear Theo ,
So at last our ’s no longer suffering — I received the news from our this morning . It seems that they’re more or less expecting you for the funeral , and perhaps you’ll be there now , in fact .
How short life is , and how like smoke . Which isn’t a reason to despise the living — on the contrary .
So we’re right to attach ourselves more to artists than to paintings .
I’m working hard for Russell . I thought I’d do a series of drawings after my painted studies for him ; I have a conviction that he’ll look favourably on them , and that , I hope at least , will further prompt him to do a deal .
MacKnight came to look again yesterday , and also found the portrait of a young girl good , and again said that he finds my garden good . I really don’t know if he has money or not .
 
Now I’m working with another model , a in a blue uniform with gold trimmings , a big , bearded face , very Socratic . A raging republican , like père Tanguy . A more interesting man than many people .
If we were to push Russell , perhaps he’d purchase the Gauguin that you bought , and if there was no other way of coming to Gauguin’s aid , what would have to be done?
When I write to him at the same time as I send the drawings , naturally it will be to get him to make up his mind .
I’ll say to him , look , you like our painting so much , but I believe that we’ll see even better by the artist ; why don’t you act like us , who have faith in the whole man just as he is , and who find everything he does good . I then want to add , of course it would be all the same to us to let you have the large painting , if necessary , but as Gauguin will still very often be in need of money ,
  in his interests should we not keep it until his prices have tripled or quadrupled — which will happen — we believe? If after that Russell wishes to make a clear , firm offer , well . . . . we could see . . . And in that case , Gauguin should say that he , even though he let you have it at that price as a friend , he himself absolutely does not wish for it to be given to another art lover at that price . Anyway — let’s finish the drawings ; I have 8 of them and I’ll do 12 , and let’s wait and see what he says .
I’m very curious to know if you were able to go to Holland , yes or no . For the moment I won’t write any more .
The change that I’m going to try to make in my paintings will be to do more figures .
In short , it’s the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite . More than the rest .
 
On the 17th of this month , my the second lieutenant of Zouaves will go to Paris . He has offered to take charge of my consignment that I have to make to you , and I believe I’ll accept that ; that way you’ll have them , and without costs , on the 18th .
I’ll write to our today ; they’ll all be feeling very sad .
Have you received Bernard’s croquis?
As our says , from the moment that people are no longer there , we remember only their good moments and good qualities .
However , it’s above all a question of trying to see them while they’re still there . It would be so simple and would explain so well the horrors of life that now amaze us and distress us so if life had another , second hemisphere , invisible , it’s true , but where we arrive when we breathe our last . To those who are making this interesting and solemn journey , our best wishes and our best sympathies .
If you go to Holland , my warm regards to our and . Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
The week will be pretty hard , having to pay the rent and having a model .
I hope to make some of these croquis after the painted studies for you too ; you’ll see that it has a certain Japanese look .
 
I still have to thank you for yesterday’s 50-franc note , and reply to your letter .
You did well to send the colours and canvases , my supplies being exhausted across the board .
As far as Bing’s concerned , as for being in a hurry: no . Only far from breaking off relations , we should take more on commission as soon as we can pay .
I saw a magnificent and very strange effect this evening . A very large boat laden with coal on the Rhône , moored at the quay . Seen from above it was all glistening and wet from a shower ; the water was a white yellow and clouded pearl-grey , the sky lilac and an orange strip in the west , the town violet . On the boat , small workmen , blue and dirty white , were coming and going , carrying the cargo ashore . It was pure Hokusai . It was too late to do it , but one day , when this coal-boat comes back ,
  it’ll have to be tackled .
It’s in a railway yard that I saw this effect ; it’s a place that I’ve just found and where there will be plenty of other things to do .
Handshake , because if I want to write more to Holland I’ll have to hurry .
I’ll have difficulty getting all the way through this week .
But I hope to get started on the series of figures .
