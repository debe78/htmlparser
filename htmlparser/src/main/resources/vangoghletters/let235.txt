Letter|My dear Theo ,
Today , Saturday , I’m sending you the two drawings
Fish-drying barn in the dunes , Scheveningen
Carpenter’s yard and laundry (from the window of my studio) .
I’ve thought of you so often these past few days , and also occasionally about the time long ago when , as you will remember , you visited me in The Hague and we walked along Trekweg to Rijswijk and drank milk at the mill there . It may be that this influenced me somewhat when I did these drawings , in which I have tried as naїvely as possible to draw things exactly as I saw them . At the time of the mill , however dear those days still are to me , it would have been impossible for me to put what I saw and felt on paper . So what I’m saying is that the changes brought about by time have not fundamentally altered my feelings ; it’s just that I believe they have taken a different form . My life , and yours too perhaps , after all , is no longer as sunny as it was then , but I still wouldn’t want to go back , because it’s precisely through some trouble and adversity that I see something good emerging , namely the expression of those feelings .
Rappard was pleased with a similar drawing which C . M . has , and moreover with all the others C . M . has . Especially with the largest of the almshouse . And he is someone who understands what I want and appreciates how difficult it is . I believe you would find Rappard much changed since his first time in Paris when you knew him .
I have in front of me a volume of the Household edition of Dickens , with illustrations . They are excellent and are drawn by Barnard and Fildes . They show parts of Old London , which take on a very different appearance from the carpenter’s yard , for example , also because of the peculiarities of the wood engraving . Yet I still believe that the way to get that boldness and daring later is to quietly carry on observing as faithfully as possible now . As you see , there are several planes in this drawing , and one can look around in it and peer into all sorts of nooks and crannies . It lacks that ruggedness as yet , at least doesn’t by any means have that quality to the same extent as the above illustrations , but that will come with practice .
 
I have heard from C . M . in the form of a postal order for 20 guilders but without a single word to go with it . So for the time being I haven’t the slightest idea whether he wants to order something new from me or whether the drawings are to his taste . But comparing it with the price paid for the previous ones , 30 guilders , and bearing in mind that this last batch (the first contained 12 small ones ; this had 1 small one , 4 like the enclosed and 2 large ones – i . e . 7 items in all) was more substantial than the first , it seems to me that His Hon . had got out of the wrong side of the bed the day he received them , or that they failed to please for some reason or another . I readily admit that , to an eye used only to watercolours , drawings which have been scratched by pen or had lights scraped off or put back on in body-colour may seem a little harsh . But there are also people who , just as it is sometimes pleasant and invigorating for a healthy constitution to go for a walk when a strong wind is blowing , so there are also art lovers , I say , who aren’t afraid of the harsh .
Weissenbruch , for example , wouldn’t find these two drawings disagreeable or dull .
In the circumstances , should I learn that C . M . would rather not have any more , of course I cannot and will not force them on His Hon . , but I hope that , for example when you come , you will be able to find out how things really stand .
Naturally , although I hadn’t expected him to give me 10 guilders less for this batch than for the previous one , I agree with the 20 guilders , all the more so because I left it to His Hon . to fix the price . And if he wants me to start on another 6 or 12 , I’m ready to do that because I don’t want to miss any opportunity to sell something . I really want to do my best to accommodate His Hon . , because I think that it’s worth the effort as long as I get my rent out of it and can make ends meet more easily . It’s just that His Hon . himself talked about giving more , not less , for more detailed drawings . I only raise the matter , after all , mainly to know what to do as regards a new order that is or is not to follow . It may also be that His Hon . will write to me himself later .
 
In a few days , or today if I have time , I’ll send you a brief list of what is in my collection of wood engravings . I’m so sure you will take pleasure in them . While I spent less on paint this winter than others did , I had more expenses in connection with the study of perspective and proportion for an instrument described in a work by Albrecht Dürer and used by the Dutchmen of old . It makes it possible to compare the proportions of objects close at hand with those on a plane further away , in cases where construction according to the rules of perspective isn’t feasible . Which , if you do it by eye , will always come out wrong , unless you’re very experienced and skilled .
I didn’t manage to make the thing the first time around , but I succeeded in the end after trying for a long time with the aid of the carpenter and the smith . And I think that with more work I can get much better results still .
It would please me greatly if perhaps in your wardrobe there was a jacket and trousers suitable for me which you no longer wear .
Because if I buy something I like it to be as practical as possible for working in the dunes or indoors , but my clothes for going out are getting rather threadbare . And while I am not ashamed to be seen in the streets in a cheap suit when I go out to work , I am decidedly ashamed by gentleman’s clothes that give the impression of a gentleman down on his luck . My everyday clothes , however , aren’t at all shoddy , because now I have Sien to keep check of them and make minor repairs .
I end this letter by saying to you again that I so dearly wish that the family should not view my relationship with Sien as something of which there isn’t the slightest question , namely an intrigue . Which I would find unspeakably offensive and would only widen the gulf . What I hope is that they don’t interfere , with some ill-timed wisdom , to prevent me from being with her . I mean of the same sort as when Pa wanted to pack me off to Geel . The speculating about inheritances that you mention is quite out of the question , if only because there are no inheritances for me as far as I know , and indeed there cannot be for there is nothing . I believe there is literally no money at home . The only person from whom , in very different circumstances , I might perhaps have inherited something because I share his name , Uncle Cent , is someone with whom I have been on bad terms for many years on account of numerous things , and in such a manner that by the nature of the matter it cannot be resolved as if I were his protégé , because I myself certainly wouldn’t want that , and of course he hasn’t the slightest thought of any such thing any more , although I hope that , just like last year , if I meet His Hon . we shall not make a public scene . And now with a handshake
Ever yours ,
Vincent
