Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m really waiting for the money ; I had hoped it might have been possible for you to send it a few days earlier .
I’ve written to you at length about how my intention of painting 50 or so heads means that I have to incur even more expenses than usual . And since you yourself gave cause by writing that you were suspicious of me , I’m put out when I think that it’s probably more due to this than to anything else that I’m sometimes embarrassed . I wouldn’t mind that I don’t sell , if the work itself could carry on at full speed anyway . Still , I do what I can , and I’m making progress with it after all .
You’ll also have to take back what you write to me about your suspiciousness .
 
When — you’ll have to decide that for yourself — but I just warn you that the very worst misunderstandings come about because of suspicion .
For my part , I’m sometimes upset that your character seems to have set fast in a form which I believe could cause you disquiet later . But what’s the use of talking about it? What I mean is a family ailment , it seems to me .
I always imagine that in Zundert and for a few years afterwards there was generally a better atmosphere at home . Since then , I don’t feel it’s got any better . These days — But what I don’t know is whether that former — that it was better in Zundert — is just my imagination — it could well be .
But now , in any event , it’s certainly not that . Anyway . Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
Since this summer I can’t help always visualizing you with your lorgnette with dark lenses .
This doesn’t change a person very much , you’ll say .
Maybe so — but my impression is that you have perhaps , in a sense other than the literal one , acquired dark glasses in what you think and do . Suspicion , for instance .
On the other hand , though , I think that it’s something to know Paris well — that if , once there , you become a Parisian through and through — analytical , steely , and what they call shrewd — I don’t want to be so petty-minded as to condemn it . I’m not like that . Be a Parisian , remain one — that’s fine , if it’s what you want .
There are various things in the world that are great — the sea with the fishermen — the furrows and the peasants — the mines and the colliers .
And likewise I think the pavements of Paris and the people who know their Paris well are also great .
 
Now , though , you’re making a mistake if for your part you can’t understand that your suspicion of me is downright inappropriate . Most certainly I think differently , I feel differently , I act differently .
But in its context it has its reason for being .
And whereas you wrote to me in Drenthe , when I advised you to become a painter , that I was speaking of your affairs from a distance and I conceded as much , most certainly the reverse is also the case , namely that you can only guess at what I’m doing . So keep your suspicion to yourself , because it’s simply inappropriate . And it’s precisely in the good progress of my work that the means lie , whatever may happen about being more or less in sympathy with each other , of being at least harmless to each other , even where the ways lie in quite opposite directions .
