Letter|My dear Theo ,
I received De Goncourt’s book yesterday evening . I started reading it right away , and although I’ll obviously have to read it again quietly , I already had a general view of the whole thing by this morning — you can see I’d really been looking forward to it . I don’t think he praises Boucher too much . Even if I knew nothing of Boucher but the contrast of these three things , a rich blue (sky) , a bronze (male figure) and a mother-of-pearl white (female figure) , particularly with the addition of that anecdote about the Duchess of Orleans , I would admit that he is someone in the world of painters . What’s more , he doesn’t praise him too much , because he does come out and say , vulgar — in the way that one can call the paintings of Bouguereau , Perrault &amp ; c . vulgar without selling the worthy gentlemen short . Because they lack a certain poignancy and intimacy , don’t they? What’s more he doesn’t praise Boucher too much , to my mind , because I’m not concerned for one moment that De Goncourt would deny the superiority of Rubens , say — Rubens , who was still more productive even than Boucher , no less than him but even more the painter of nude women .
 
Which in Rubens very often does not detract from the poignancy and intimacy that I mean , particularly not in those portraits of his wives in which he is , or surpasses , himself .
But Chardin .
I’ve often longed to know something about the man . (Watteau was exactly as I thought . ) Third Estate . Corot-like as far as bonhomie is concerned — with more sadness and adversity in his life .
It’s a splendid book . La Tour witty and Voltaire-like .
Pastel is a process I’d really like to know . I’ll do it later , too . If one can paint a head , one must be able to learn it in a few hours .
I greatly enjoyed what he says about Chardin’s technique .
I’m more and more convinced that the true painters didn’t finish in the sense in which people all too often used finish — that’s to say clear if one stands with one’s nose pressed to it .
The best paintings — precisely the most perfect from a technical point of view —
  seen from close to are touches of colour next to one another , and create their effect at a certain distance . Rembrandt persisted in this despite all the trouble he had to suffer as a result (the worthy citizens thought Van der Helst much better for the reason that one can also see it close to) . In that respect , Chardin is as great as Rembrandt . Israëls has something of the same , and for my part I always find Israëls admirable , specifically in his technique .
It would be too good if everyone knew this and thought about it like this , as Bonnemort would say . At the same time , to bring this off one has to be able to do a little magic , which costs one dear to learn , and Michelangelo’s gloomy , sarcastic words — my manner is destined to make great fools — is also true of those who dare take risks in regard to colour — there , too , it can’t be imitated by the cowards and the dependent .
I believe I’m making progress with the work .
Yesterday evening something happened to me that I’ll tell you as precisely as I can . You know the 3 pollard oaks at the end of the garden at home — I slogged away at them for the 4th time . I’d sat in front of them for three days with a canvas the size of that cottage , say , and the peasant cemetery you have .
 
The thing was the canopies of Havana-coloured leaves — how to model them and get the form , the colour , the tone . Then one evening I took it with me to that of mine in Eindhoven , who has quite an elegant drawing room (grey wallpaper — furniture black with gold) , where we hung it .
Well now , never before have I felt such a conviction that I’ll make things that work , that I’ll succeed in calculating my colours such that I have it in my power to create an effect . That was Havana , soft green and white-grey — even pure white straight from the tube . (You see that for my part , even though I talk about dark , I have no prejudice against the other extreme , the utmost extreme even . )
Although the man has money , although he really liked it — I had such a tingle of good spirits when I saw that it worked , that it created a mood as it hung there because of the soft , melancholy peace of that colour combination — that I COULD not sell .
But because it had affected him , I gave it to him , and he accepted it just as I meant it , without many words , that’s to say little other than — ‘the thing’s damned good’ .
I don’t yet think so myself — I must first see some more Chardin , Rembrandt , Old Dutch and French fellows and really think things over — because I want to work even more vigorously with rather less paint than I used in this thing , for instance .
Now as to my acquaintance and his opinion of paintings — if someone with a clear , rational mind paints still lifes and works outside day in and day out , even if it’s only for a year , then he may not be an art expert as a result ,
  then he doesn’t yet feel himself to be painter — but — nonetheless sees more coolly than many another . And then there’s also this about him , that his character is not like just anyone’s . For instance , he was originally supposed to have become a clergyman — at a certain moment flatly refused — and — got his way in that , which by no means everyone in Brabant succeeds in doing . And has something generous and loyal about him . This is something Zola once referred to — when in a conversation between Mouret and his school friend , he makes Mouret get serious and say that it has taken him a great deal of effort to overcome that time and its influence in himself , but that he wanted to live and that he was living . Many who endeavour to change slip back , don’t get any further than a certain colourless Methodism because they don’t take any measures vigorously enough . But that’s not the case with him ; he is a man in his bourgeois world .
Did you know that the De Goncourt made etchings and drawings? You mustn’t think I’m being impractical if I decidedly go on trying to encourage you either to draw or to paint . I know you won’t fail . I know if you put your mind to it , the result wouldn’t be petty . And specifically in the trade , specifically as an art expert , it would give you an ascendancy over many others .
  An ascendancy that one actually does need . I return for a moment to that acquaintance of mine — it’s exactly a year since I saw him for the first time , when I was making that large sketch of a water mill which you possibly know . (The colour of that one is just maturing nicely . ) Now here’s a description of a study by that of mine — some roofs , backs of houses , factory chimneys , dark against an evening sky . That evening sky blue , shading at the horizon into a glow , between clouds of a smoky colour with orange , or rather , reddish reflections . The bulk of the houses dark , but still a warm brick colour , a silhouette that has something sombre and threatening about it .
Foreground a vague bit of ground in the twilight , black sand , withered grass , a garden anyway , with a few dismal black apple trunks in it , a small canopy of yellow autumn leaves on them here and there . He made this absolutely entirely of his own accord , but isn’t it a good concept , a real impression , well felt? But one isn’t a painter in a year , nor is that necessary . Only there’s already a good thing running through it , and hope is alive instead of one feeling powerless in front of a wall .
I don’t know how things will go for me from now on . At the moment , when I read about that outstanding devil , that famous La Tour —
  how real it is , by Jove — and — how well (apart from his terrible avarice) that fellow tackled life and — painting . I’ve only just seen Frans Hals — well now , you know how I was full of it , wrote to you at length about it straightaway , about putting things down in one go . Well , what a similarity there is between the ideas of La Tour &amp ; c . and Frans Hals , when they express life in pastel that one could blow away . I don’t know what I’ll do or how things will go for me , but I hope I won’t forget these lessons I’ve been taking recently: in one go , quickly but with absolutely total exertion of everything one may have in the way of spirit and attention .
Nowadays — I like nothing better than working with a brush — drawing with it too — instead of making a design in charcoal . When I ask myself how the old Dutchmen set about it , I come up against the relatively few actual drawings . And how astoundingly they — draw . But — I believe that in most cases they began , they progressed , they ended — with their brush .
They — didn’t fill in .
A Van Goyen — for instance — I’ve just seen the one of his in the Dupper Collection , an oak tree on a dune
  in a storm , and the Cuyp , view of Dordrecht . An astounding technique — but — with nothing and as if of its own accord and beyond the paint and — apparently perfectly simple . But — be it in the figure — be it in landscape — how painters have always striven to convince people that a painting is something other than nature in a mirror , something other than imitation , that’s to say re-creation .
I would like to tell you a lot more about what Chardin , in particular , makes me think about colour — and — not making things the local colour . I think it’s splendid: ‘How to surprise — how to define the substance of this toothless mouth with its infinite subtleties . It’s made with nothing more than a few streaks of yellow and a few sweeping strokes of blue!!!’ When I read this , I thought of – Vermeer of Delft . When one sees it from close to , the townscape in The Hague is incredible , and done with completely different colours from what one would suppose a few steps away .
Regards , I really wanted to tell you right away how good I think De Goncourt’s book .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
