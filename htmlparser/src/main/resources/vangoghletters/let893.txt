Letter|My dear Theo ,
You could send the attached order for colours at the beginning of the month , anyway at the most convenient moment , there’s no urgency for a few days earlier or later .
Yesterday and the day before yesterday I painted Miss Gachet’s portrait , which you’ll see soon , I hope . The dress is pink .
The wall in the background green with orange spots , the carpet red with green spots , the piano dark violet . It’s 1 metre high and 50 wide .
It’s a figure I enjoyed painting – but it’s difficult .
He’s promised to get her to pose for me another time with a little organ . I’ll do one for you – I noticed that this canvas looks very good with another horizontal one of wheatfields , thus – one canvas being vertical and pink , the other pale green and green-yellow , complementing the pink .
But we’re still a long way from people understanding the curious relationships that exist between one piece of nature and another , which however explain and bring each other out .
 
But a few , though , do feel it , and that’s already something . And then this has been gained , that in women’s clothes one sees very pretty arrangements of bright colours . If only one could have the individuals one sees pass by to do their portraits , it would be as pretty as any past era , and I even think that often in nature there is currently all the grace of Puvis’s painting , Between art and nature . Thus yesterday I saw two figures , the mother in dark carmine dress , the daughter in pale pink with a yellow hat without any ornamentation , very healthy figures , rustic , well tanned by the open air , burned by the sun , the mother especially with a very , very red face and black hair and two diamonds in her ears . And I thought again of that canvas by Delacroix , Maternal upbringing . For in the expressions on the faces there really was everything that there was in the head of George Sand . Do you know that there’s a bust-length portrait of George Sand by Delacroix , there’s a wood engraving of it in L’Illustration – with the hair cut short .
Good handshake in thought to you and Jo , and good fortune with the one .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
