Letter|My dear Vincent ,
A few words in haste to thank you for your last letter and to tell you that I don’t consider your going to St-Rémy as a retreat , as you say , but simply as a momentary rest so as to come back soon with new strength .
I remember seeing something that struck me greatly a long time ago . In rue des Petits-Carreaux I saw a very heavy dray which had to climb that street . The driver struck his four horses harder and harder , but right in the middle the worn-out horses refused to go a step further . So he made them turn round and , when they were back at the bottom of the street , almost without resting them , he turned round
  again and arrived at the top of the street without difficulty . I’d very much like you to tell me how you’re treated in the establishment and what the food is like etc . Mr Salles said many good things about what he had seen . He has been perfect , he wrote me a long letter to give me an account of his visit . As I only know from your telegram that you have gone , I don’t know if he accompanied you as he proposed to do . In the Salon there’s a very fine painting by Raffaëlli , two absinthe drinkers . I find him strongest when he paints these people who have come down in the world , although the portrait of two young girls in white may perhaps be the best portrait in the Salon . Zorn has female bathers at the seaside , somewhat in the genre of In Arcady by Harrison , which you remember perhaps . There’s a Birth of Christ by Uhde , triptych , in which there’s a pretty sentiment . There’s very little of interest in all of this penny bazaar . I’m entirely of your opinion that one mustn’t believe solely in Impressionism , but still there must be that individual aspect which is lacking in almost everything there is in the Salon .
More soon and look after yourself . Good handshake .
Theo
