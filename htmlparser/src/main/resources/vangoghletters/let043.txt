Letter|Paris , 2 Sept . 1875
My dear Borchers ,
Thanks for your letter , which I received this morning and which gave me pleasure . I hope to come to Holland at Christmas and , if I can , immediately to The Hague , and we must then make sure not to miss each other .
I’m glad that you still have a passion for reading , that’s always good , at least such books as you read . I still keep it up , too ; an employee in our office who has gone on holiday
  to Holland has just promised to bring me a copy of ‘Motley , Geschiedenis der 17 provinciën’ .
As you know , I’m now in Paris ; so I’ve wandered rather a lot since we saw each other on my last day in The Hague , and it seems to me that it was a great deal longer than 2 years ago .
Warm regards , give my regards to your Mother and as well , and believe me
Ever yours ,
V . W . van Gogh
