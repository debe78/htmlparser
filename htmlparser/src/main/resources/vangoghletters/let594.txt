Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter and for the 100-franc note it contained . I’ve sent you croquis of the paintings intended for Holland . Goes without saying that the painted studies are more brilliant in colour . Am hard at work again , still orchards in blossom .
The air here is definitely doing me good , I could wish you deep lungfuls of it . One of its effects is quite funny , one small glass of cognac goes to my head down here , so without having recourse to stimulants to get my blood circulating , my constitution won’t be taxed so much all the same .
But I’ve had a terribly weak stomach since I’ve been here , well , that’s probably a matter of a lot of patience .
I hope to make real progress this year , which I really need to do too .
I’ve got a new orchard that’s as good as the pink peach trees -– some very pale pink apricot trees . At present I’m working on some yellow-white plum trees with thousands of black branches .
I’m using vast quantities of canvases and colours but all the same I hope not to waste money .
 
Out of 4 canvases perhaps there’ll scarcely be one that would make a painting like Tersteeg’s or Mauve’s , but we’ll be able to use the studies for exchanges , I hope . When will I be able to send you something? I’d so much like to do two of Tersteeg’s , because it’s better than the Asnières studies .
Yesterday I saw a bullfight where five men were working the ox with banderillas and rosettes . A toreador crushed one of his balls jumping over the barrier . He was a blond man with grey eyes and a lot of sang-froid , they said he’d feel it for a long time . He was dressed in sky-blue and gold , just like the little horseman in our Monticelli with the 3 figures in a wood . The bullring looks so beautiful when there’s sunshine and a crowd .
Bravo for Pissarro , he’s right , I think . I hope he’ll do an exchange with us one day .
The same for Seurat , it would be a good thing to have a painted study by him .
 
Anyway , I’m working hard , hoping we’ll be able to do things of this kind .
The month will be hard for you and me , but nevertheless , if you can manage it , it’s to our advantage to do as many orchards in blossom as we can . I’m now well under way and I need 10 more , I think , same subject .
You know I’m changeable in my work , and this rage to paint orchards won’t last for ever . After that it may be bullrings . And I have an ENORMOUS amount of drawing to do , because I’d like to do drawings in the style of Japanese prints . I can’t do anything but strike while the iron’s hot . Will be worn out after the orchards , because they’re no . 25 and 30 and 20 canvases .
We wouldn’t have too many if I could knock off twice the number . Because I believe that could perhaps melt the ice in Holland once and for all . Mauve’s death was a rude shock for me . You’ll easily see that the pink peach trees were painted with a certain passion .
  I also need a starry night with Cypresses or — perhaps above a field of ripe wheat , there are some really beautiful nights here . I have a constant fever for work .
Am quite curious to know what the results will be after a year , I hope by then I’ll be less troubled by fits of faintness . At the moment I suffer a lot some days , but that doesn’t worry me in the least because it’s nothing but the reaction to this past winter , which wasn’t normal . And the blood’s restoring itself , that’s the main thing .
We must reach the point where my paintings are worth what I spend and even exceed that , seeing that so much has been spent already . Ah well , we’ll get there . Not everything I do is a success , of course , but the work’s getting along . Up to now you haven’t complained about what I spend here , but let me warn you that if I continue my work at the same rate I’ll find it hard to manage . But the work’s excessive .
If a month or a fortnight comes when you feel hard up let me know — then I’ll turn my hand to doing drawings and that will cost us less . This is to tell you that you shouldn’t force yourself for no reason — there’s so much to do here , all sorts of studies , that it’s not the same as in Paris , where you can’t sit down wherever you please .
 
If it’s possible to manage a bit of a steep month , so much the better , because orchards in blossom are subjects we have a chance of selling or exchanging . But I thought about the fact that you’ll have the rent to pay , and that’s why you must let me know if you’re too hard up .
I’m still going about with the Danish , but he’s going home soon . He’s an intelligent boy , and fine as far as loyalty and manners go , but his painting is still very poor . You’ll probably see him when he passes through Paris .
It was kind of you to go and see Bernard . If he does his service in Algeria , who knows , perhaps I’ll go and keep him company .
Has winter come to an end in Paris at long last?
 
I think what Kahn says is quite true , that I haven’t paid enough attention to values , but it’ll be quite another thing they’ll say later — and no less true .
It’s not possible to do both values and colour .
Théodore Rousseau has done it better than anyone else , by mixing his colours the darkness caused by time has increased , and now his paintings are hardly recognizable .
You can’t be at the pole and the equator at the same time . You have to choose . And I have high hopes of doing that , too , and it will probably be colour .
More soon , handshake from me to you , to Koning and to the pals .
Vincent
