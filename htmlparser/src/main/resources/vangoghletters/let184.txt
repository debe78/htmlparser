Letter|Etten , 12/9-1881
My dear Rappard ,
Because I’ve not yet had a letter from you I thought: perhaps Rappard didn’t like my last letter at all , there seems to have been something in it that has made him a little peevish . What to do? Supposing that were so , is it truly good of you? I myself am not always able to judge to what extent my reasoning is right or wrong , appropriate or inappropriate . But I do know this , that even if I occasionally address you in what are possibly coarse and harsh terms , I nevertheless feel such warm sympathy for you that you will surely see and feel when calmly reading or re-reading my letter – the person who speaks to me thus is not my enemy . And knowing this , is it then so utterly unbearable for you to swallow somewhat coarse and harsh expressions even if they later appear to be less coarse and harsh than you at first thought? Rappard , why do you think it is that I speak or write to you as I do? Could it be because I want to lay a trap for you or am a kind of tempter who wants to make you fall into a pit , or could it possibly be that I really had a reason to think ‘Rappard is venturing onto thin ice!’ I now know that there are people who not only maintain their footing on thin ice but even manage to perform tours de force on it – but even if you stood so firmly in your shoes (I’m not saying that you don’t stand so firmly in them) , even then I’d prefer to see such a one walking on a footpath or street .
 
Don’t get angry now – read on – until the end – if you get angry , don’t tear up this letter without reading it – first count to ten .
One – two – three &amp ; c . . . . . . .
That’s calming . . something really bad is coming , though! What I want to say is this:
Rappard , I believe that even when you’re working at the academy you’re striving to become more and more of a true realist , and at the academy , too , you stick to reality . However , without being aware of it yourself , without knowing it , that academy is a mistress who prevents a more serious , a warmer , a more fertile love from awakening in you . Let the mistress go and fall madly in love with your true love , Dame Nature or Reality .
I’ve also fallen in love like that , madly in love with a Dame Nature or Reality , and have felt so happy ever since , even though she’s still resisting me strenuously and doesn’t want me yet , and often raps my knuckles if I dare over-hastily to think of her as mine . So I’m far from saying that I’ve already got her , but I’m courting her and seeking the key to her heart despite the painful knuckle-rapping .
Now you don’t have to think that there is but one Dame Nature or Reality , no , that’s only the surname of various sisters , who have a variety of Christian names . So we don’t have to be rivals . Do you understand , my dear chap? Of course it’s purely artistic , is it not?
 
Now in my opinion there are two kinds of mistress . One is the kind with whom one can give and take love , one or both of you being aware , meanwhile , that it isn’t forever , neither does one surrender to it whole-heartedly and unreservedly .
Such mistresses get on one’s nerves , they coax , they spoil one , then – then — . . . they burn up a good many men .
The second kind of mistress is of an entirely different disposition . The strait-laced – Pharisees – Jesuits!!! They are the kind of women of marble – sphinx – cold vipers — who would like to bind men to themselves , entirely , for ever and ever , without her ever surrendering whole-heartedly , entirely , unreservedly . They suck your blood . Such mistresses freeze men , and petrify them .
But I said it was purely artistic , my dear chap – and so I compare the first kind of mistress , those who burn , with that school of art that lapses into generalities . And then I compare the other kind of mistress (the strait-laced) , those who freeze and petrify , with academic reality or – or – if you want me to gild the pill , with not unacademic reality – more gilding won’t stick to the pill , I’m afraid you’ll see through it . The pill is bitter , but salutary ; it’s a quinine pill .
Do you understand , my dear chap!
Now there are – thank God – other women besides these two kinds – that is the family of Dames Nature and Reality , but it costs a great deal of inner struggle to win one .
They demand nothing more nor less than complete surrender of the heart , soul , mind in one certain direction , all the love that’s in us , and then – then – they also give themselves . However , these true Dames Nature , though harmless as doves , are also wise as serpents , and know very well how to distinguish between who is sincere and who is insincere .
  She renews , she reinvigorates , she gives life! This Dame Nature , this Dame Reality .
Rappard , there are people , and perhaps you and I are such , who don’t understand , until they really love , that before that time , consciously or unconsciously , they’ve had mistresses of one or other of these dispositions , or perhaps aren’t unacquainted with both varieties .
You have , in my opinion , a mistress who freezes you , petrifies you and sucks your blood .
So , friend , I say you must tear yourself from the arms of that woman of marble (or is it but plaster??? how horrible!) , otherwise you’ll freeze to death!
Believe , meanwhile , that if I’m a tempter who wants to pull you down into a deep pit , this pit could be the ‘well of truth’ . In short – no longer sing the praises of not unacademic mistress (artistically)! In my opinion she’s a shrew . My dear chap , it’s my opinion that she’ll deceive you if you allow yourself to be taken in . The devil with her! Send her packing , and the sooner the better! But it’s purely artistic , is it not — my dear chap?
Indeed it is! If , apart from and in addition to that , it was something else altogether — so much the better — I’m not eating my words . As long , that is , as you’d take my words in a non-figurative sense . Do you understand , my dear chap , and — and — tell me — will you write to me now , the sooner the better , eh? Believe me always , with a handshake
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I recently made a drawing , Mealtime , a worker drinking a cup of coffee and cutting a slice of bread . On the ground a spade he’s brought in from the field .
 
She’s a little cold , though , my dear chap , the one that you say you love , the one who is your ideal for the time being . She is indeed as I had pictured her — marble , plaster , what can I say — a sleep-walker , at most . Alive — no .
So you say:	 
does she come from? . . . From heaven .
Where does she live? . . . . . All over the world .
Her intentions? . . . . The beautiful and the sublime .
But , look , you’re sincere at least , and without knowing it you’re fully in agreement with me in that you admit to having a mistress . One of those whom I’ve dubbed strait-laced prudes &amp ; c . &amp ; c .
That’s just it , you describe her very well . But what a Pharisee she is , that beauty , and you , you’re so in love with her , what a pity!
Madame , who are you? I am ‘the beautiful , the sublime’ . Tell me , though , my beautiful and sublime , the one who feels herself such , is she so in fact?
I certainly agree that in some of life’s crises , in great pain , in transports of joy , one may feel oneself beautiful and sublime , and of course I hope to be among those who know how to appreciate those things . But the fact remains that You , Madame , leave me cold and without any emotion whatsoever . How does that come about?
I don’t , after all , have too thick a skin , I do hope ; people who weren’t even pretty , not exactly sublime , have often charmed me , but you , Madame , do not charm me in the very least . One doesn’t make a profession of the beautiful and the sublime!
Madame , I do not love you , and what’s more , I do not believe that you yourself could love unless in certain academic heavens , of course — but on the heath or in private , by the fireside , no , not at all . Don’t sing me that tune , Madame the beautiful , the sublime , you don’t know the first thing about it .
 
Do you see , Madame , I’m just a man of human passions , and for as long as I walk ‘down here’ on the heath , I don’t have time to worry about a celestial , mystical love , as long as I feel another , of a more frank and earthly nature . I do need the beautiful and the sublime , I admit it , but first of all I also need something other than that — to start with — kindness and good will , tenderness ; do you have much of those , Madame Pharisee? I’m inclined to doubt it . And , Madame , tell me , do you actually have a body and soul? I’m inclined to doubt it ; as much , indeed , for the body as for the soul .
Listen , my lovely one , from wherever you may claim to come , you who say your fundamental intentions are ‘the beautiful and the sublime’ (which could only be results , never intentions) , from wherever you may come , I say , it’s surely not from the Bosom of the living God , and it’s not from the bosom of a woman , either . Away with you , Sphinx , clear off , and the sooner the better — I tell you — you’re nothing but a joke . You don’t exist . (De debil ton’t exeest , Nucingen would say . )
However , if you do exist , if in fact you come from somewhere , are you quite sure and certain that your origin isn’t Satan himself , father of lies? Are you any less a viper and a serpent than he , Madame , the beautiful , the sublime?
To say that as far as I’m concerned your mistress , ‘the beautiful , the sublime , who says she comes from heaven and lives over all the earth’ , is a more than suspect person , that wouldn’t be putting things strongly enough .
Ask her if she’s good and useful , if she loves , and needs love . She’ll become flustered , and if she says yes , it’s a lie .
 
    She – the other one , that is , not the one with the above-mentioned ‘intentions’ , where does she come from?
I’m far from denying her divinity , her immortality ; I believe in it very firmly , and in the first place , even ; however , she’s definitely earthly , too , and definitely a woman , and born of a woman .
    She?– Where she lives , I know well where , and it’s not very far from each one of us .
    She– Her intentions? What do I know of them , how to say it — I’d like to keep silent — however , since we must speak — ah , well — it seems to me: to love and to be lovably — to live , to give life , to renew it , to heal it , to preserve it , to work , to give back spark for spark ; above all , to be good , to be useful — to be of some use , to light the fire , for example , to give a child a piece of bread and butter , a sick man a glass of water .
    Ah , but all that is very beautiful , very sublime . Yes , but she didn’t know that it was called that , she believed that it was quite simple , she doesn’t do it on purpose , it wasn’t her intention to make as much noise as that , she believed nobody paid attention
    Her own ‘arguments’ , you see , aren’t very brilliant , not very well thought out . Her sentiment is always right .
    To know what her duty is she doesn’t go to her head , she goes to her heart .
But she’s in no way a mistress , that one . Since a lady is a lady , as Michelet says .
 
Meanwhile , Rappard , that business of the competition I find rather amusing .
No . 11 is first of all the fool’s number and , moreover , ‘last’ is also a good sign sometimes , so I offer you my sincere congratulations , for in my opinion one thing and another are good omens for you . It’s promising .
Now , I still have quite a lot against various principles of yours too , but because my bête noire in the circumstances is that particular mistress , I’ll leave the principles alone . If you could sack Mme the beautiful , the sublime , and fall in love with ‘the other’ , it seems to me that that would put entirely different principles in your head and in your heart . And I perceive from certain signs that , no matter how much you’re still attached to Mme the beautiful and sublime , you won’t be able to stand her much longer . Unless she petrifies you and turns you to ice and transfixes you in that way , but that seems unlikely to me , you have too much good sense for that . Be on your guard — keep warm — you know — (a little precaution to take against her chilling influence) , and take lots of walks — (especially when you feel a little petrification coming on) . Forewarned is forearmed , so you’re forewarned , then .
Don’t be annoyed with me ; if it wasn’t an academic expression , I would say , ‘it’s for your own good’ .
Finally , much good may it do you , I have another bête noire to hunt down , but I shan’t tell you which , now . But listen , and I’ll tell you anyway . This other bête noire is ‘resignation in disappointments’ . Another incredibly Jesuitical , Pharisaical invention . But that’s theological , very theological . My dear chap , never resign yourself and never be disappointed , that’s the best advice I could give you , it’s even better than my advice to send your cold mistress to the devil , all the more so since these two pieces of advice amount to only one . I shake your hand , believe me always
Ever yours ,
Vincent
