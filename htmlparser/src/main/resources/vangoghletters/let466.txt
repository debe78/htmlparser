Letter|My dear Theo ,
Here are a couple more cartes de visite to give you an idea of that decoration for Hermans — of which these are two canvases .
Rappard is here at the moment and sends you his regards . He’s made a very fine study of a girl’s head and one of a farmyard , and two small ones of ox-carts . And various others that he’s planning should follow .
I’m working on a figure of a shepherd wearing a greatcoat — which is the same size as the woman spinning .
And apart from that a study of two Pollard willows with the yellow leaves of poplars behind them and a view across the fields .
 
It’s extraordinarily beautiful here at the moment with the autumnal effects . In a fortnight we’ll have the real fall of the leaves — when everything that’s on the trees falls in a few days .
If I have some luck with the shepherd , it will be a figure that will have something of the very old Brabant in it . Anyway , it isn’t finished yet , and we’ll see how it turns out .
You could have dropped me a line in reply to what I wrote to you recently — it seems to me — even if it was only because it might shake up your own ideas , perhaps . For my part — despite much old and new sorrow — I have less and less doubt about my future , both as to my work and even as to myself .
 
All the same , I know that I’ll have many a struggle in both respects — that both my work and I myself will meet with resistance , will make a bad impression in many cases , but not in all .
And as to my work , I become keener on it by the day , and I’m regaining my high spirits as if I were 20 .
So I must see to it that I go to Antwerp sometime — often enough in the past I’ve sold things that authorities declared unsaleable . If I wanted to sell something in the past then it didn’t always fall through if I really wanted someone to take this thing or that .
And perhaps you’re right that I should just find a way for my work myself , and become my own dealer . Anyway .
Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
