Letter|3 February
My dear Theo ,
I dearly long for your letter again , and since it’s 3 Feb . already (and it’s past the postman’s time today) I’m writing as a precaution . If it’s because you wrote a few days later it will be all right , but owing to what happened with the letter this winter I’m letting you know in case you wrote before the first . Then it might be as well if you made enquiries .
I’ve noticed that the postmen sometimes give letters for Schenkweg to people living there instead of delivering them themselves . For the postmen it’s sometimes a long way off their route , and I know this because the postman asked me to deliver something for him the other day , which of course I did — though I thought about the lost letter . Oh well .
We’ve had storms here of late , especially last night . There’ll be rough seas .
How is your getting along? In what you write I see things that touch me deeply (such as that she paid the debt of the man who had deceived her) , that are really noble . That not finding that member of parliament ‘at home’ reminded me of the name that Punch gives to the secretary of home affairs (the Home Secretary is his title) . In Punch this personage is never called anything but the Seldom at Home Secretary . What a lot of these Seldom-at-home people there are! And Dickens calls all of them together the circumlocution office .
A great many people stand sighing before the door of these how-not-to-do-it institutions , and their sighs may be no less deep than those on the old Bridge of Sighs .
 
I’ve been feeling very weak of late — I fear that I’ve rather overworked myself — and those ‘dregs’ of working , those afterpains of exertion , how horrible they are . Then life has the colour of dirty water , it’s like a rubbish dump .
At those times one would like to have a friend near one . Sometimes that clears up the dim mist .
On such days I sometimes worry terribly about the future and am melancholy about my work , and feel powerless . But it’s dangerous to speak too much of this or to keep thinking about it , so enough .
I’ve nevertheless been working on a watercolour sketch , again of diggers , or rather road-menders , here in Schenkweg , but it’s no good .
I’ve also drawn a few figures in conté that are better , I believe .
Not just with conté , but making the whole thing wet and letting the shadows flow , the lights heightened again . It may also be that I’ve caught a cold — but before I can really do anything I must get over this lack of energy .
I’m reading Uit mijne gevangenistijd by Fritz Reuter , which is most amusing . The Germans have their own distinctive humour that’s different from that of the English . Herkomer once did a peasant carnival , rather like Peasant Bruegel , in which that’s also strong .
 
Speaking of Herkomer , I recently read a sort of biography of him , though pretty incomplete .
But this struck me , among other things . He lived and painted for a time in an empty house , or perhaps one that wasn’t even finished , for he hadn’t got the rent . Then he was taken on by The Graphic and was relatively free of cares . But even when he was employed there , he still enjoyed little respect . To the point even that the first idea for Last muster at Chelsea Hospital , which is a drawing that differs relatively little from the final composition but has a certain rough look , was almost rejected . No one in The Graphic administration approved of it , except for the manager at the time . (I’d be most surprised if he’s still in the management . ) He made sure that the sketch was placed and asked Herkomer if he would do it again in greater detail for him . So that’s the origin of a painting that has since astounded the best in Paris and London .
NOW nearly everyone would find the first sketch very beautiful .
It also said that he’s not someone who works easily ; on the contrary , from the beginning and ever since he has struggled with a kind of awkwardness , and can’t do a painting without racking his brains a very great deal .
 
That even now he’s still described by many as disagreeable is something I find nearly incomprehensible .
It’s almost impossible to imagine anything deeper than his work .
When you come I’ll show you the woodcut of the old women’s home , less well known but no less fine than the old men .
A little like The sewing school at Katwijk by Israëls .
Well , write soon if you haven’t already done so . I’m longing for news of your . Best wishes for that and for everything . Also , my congratulations on Pa’s birthday . I sent Pa a drawing that I did after he made some comments about the first old man in the lithograph . Not because I entirely agreed with Pa , but I thought , now that I know how you would like it to be , I’ll try and make it for you . Yet I fear I haven’t succeeded . One doesn’t always manage to please people when one does one’s best . Pa didn’t write that he didn’t like it , but that was what came across anyway . It may indeed be that it’s no good . Well , when you come home they’ll show it to you . Adieu — but don’t say anything to them about it .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
