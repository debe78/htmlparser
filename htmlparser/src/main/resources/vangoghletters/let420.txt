Letter|My dear Theo ,
I just received your letter . Perhaps because your letter crossed a missive of mine in the same tone as the one you replied to today , you’ll see that I’m speaking here in a mood other than the rashness you assume . Precisely because I calmly say what I say , albeit not in the tone that’s used every day (this is a serious matter) , I can’t avail myself of your generosity in regarding it as having been spoken ‘in haste’ . It is this very view of yours (that I must have spoken in haste and without reflection) that is proof enough for me that we’re now at a point where more words wouldn’t get us any further , and I think it right that we let this matter rest .
You say you have to speak about the finances . So do I .
Brother , know that I repeat what I said before , without change , about how you have helped me nobly — and that:
money can be repaid , but not kindness such as yours .
But — this is what I want , and what you would approve of my wanting .
 
I must take measures such that I have what I have .
I mean that I can only accept that money that I can do with as I see fit without having to ask anyone’s opinion .
I would rather have 100 francs a month and free use of it , than 200 francs and not entirely free use of it .
If we were more of one mind in our views , I would consider an arrangement like the one agreed between you and me up till now to be far and away the best .
But where there’s too much difference in views , where there’s too little understanding each other , an arrangement such as the one agreed between you and me isn’t viable or wise . Supposing that , after all , both your character and mine want to avoid disorder or commotions , then we’ll break it off quietly and calmly — but definitely in such a way that neither you nor I can be criticized for folly or rashness .
 
I would wish it to remain the usual until March . That will enable me to pay everything I have to pay , and to provide myself with a few things by way of materials . First order of business that has to be dealt with .
The last year , namely ’83 , was a hard , sad year for me , and the end particularly sad , bitter and bitter . Well , we won’t refer to that again . After March we are free on both sides . But if you could still give Pa some contribution for a while , because I don’t want to be too much of a burden , that would be wise and good in my view . But this must be between Pa and you .
Then , if necessary , I’ll find something to do on the side . I don’t much care what , only not with you in the same trade . Only be aware that I definitely mean it , facing the fact that we evidently couldn’t remain sufficiently in agreement were we to go on any further , I’ll try not to
  accept any more favours in the form of money from you , since they can’t leave me completely free in my approach to life .
You’ll say that you leave me free — yes , but there’s still a certain awkwardness .
And I would rather have less from someone else , if I am not , after all , free in things that touch no one other than me personally .
You mustn’t take this to mean that I want nothing to do with you any more , the opposite is true — you’re a dealer . Very well , if I make something saleable in your view , I would even rather sell it to you than to someone else , but it must be an arrangement such that my position doesn’t become false as a result , so I really do want a sale in the literal sense . You can take this , too , just exactly as you like , I think that what I say is understandable .
I thank you for your letter , I appreciate many things in it . Regards , and believe me
Yours truly ,
Vincent
