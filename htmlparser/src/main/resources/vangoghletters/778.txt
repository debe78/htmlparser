Dear Mr Vincent ,
We were very pleased to learn that you are doing well and that the air of St-Rémy has done you good .
We understand that you are feeling well , and that the surroundings of your new residence , which is only temporary , will distract you and provide subjects for your art .
I have had a fine frame made as we had agreed , in walnut and impeccable . I delivered it to the .
I have told everyone who knows you how you are , and everyone was glad to learn that you are in good health , and we hope to have the pleasure of seeing you soon , in anticipation of which Mrs Ginoux and I send you our best regards .
Joseph Ginoux .
