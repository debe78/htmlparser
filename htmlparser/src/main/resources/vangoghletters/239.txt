Letter|The Hague , 22 June
My dear Theo ,
I received your letter of 12 June with the 50 francs enclosed in good order , and thank you sincerely for them . I haven’t replied before because I didn’t know what course my illness would take — it hasn’t improved as quickly as the doctor thought . I’ve now been here for over a fortnight and have again had to pay for a fortnight in advance , although if all goes well I’ll be allowed to leave in a week or 10 days and will then get part of my money back . This morning I spoke to the and asked him if there was a complication that might become serious . No , he said , but the message was still rest and stay here . The treatment didn’t stop at instillations: he’s been rummaging about inside the bladder with a catheter , which isn’t particularly enjoyable .
But it might perhaps be good for a great many people if they underwent this from time to time , because it’s a preventive measure for troublesome conditions that develop very , very slowly . But I assure you that I long dreadfully for a little greenery and some fresh air , for a thing like this makes you very weak and faint . I can’t draw because I must lie still almost continuously , although I have tried a few times ; it makes me too feverish . I can read but I’ve run out of books . Anyway , it will come to an end , so I must be patient .
Sien is in Leiden , but I won’t hear any news of her until she has given birth . What does what we men have signify compared with the terrible suffering that women must endure in childbirth? They are our masters when it comes to suffering pain , but in other things we are the winners . Until the last day she was here she visited me regularly and brought me a little smoked meat or sugar or bread , which is now finished , leaving me feeling very faint . But now I’m so sorry that I can’t in turn
  give her a tonic in Leiden , which she’d certainly welcome , for what you get there is only weak fare . I find it such an odd feeling not to be able to do anything and to watch the days passing so emptily . Sometimes I think I can do this or that , but find I’m too weak .
It pleases me greatly that you saw something in the drawings I sent — I laboured so hard on them , and on those for C . M . well , in those last days when I felt so much more pain and anxiety than here . For the worst was before I came to this hospital , long before .
And now I must tell you that I’ve had a letter from Rappard . Of course I had immediately returned the 2 . 50 guilders , and after that I received a reply from him in which he repeats what he said about my drawings in the studio , namely that he enjoyed them and found them sympathetic , mainly because of the conception , the sentiment and the intention . He suggested that if I had something similar I should send it to him , because he thought he could find a customer for it . You do understand that what I want most is for people to enjoy my work ; that gives me such pleasure . For it’s so disheartening and stifling and crushing if you don’t even occasionally hear: this or that is right and felt and meant . It’s so exhilarating when you see that someone really does feel something of what you’ve tried to express . He was also pleased by a few nude studies .
 
This is the first time for several days that I’ve sat up , and as I write I feel some life stirring . If only I were cured! If only I could settle myself as I need , how I would love to do some studies here in the wards . I’m now in a different ward with beds or cots without curtains , and especially in the evening or at night there are curious effects . The doctor is just the way I like , absolutely not Blom Coster . He resembles some heads by Rembrandt , a fine forehead and a very sympathetic expression . I hope to have learned something from him , in the sense that I hope to deal with models rather as he deals with patients , namely tackling them firmly , setting them shortly and sharply in the precise position required . It’s extraordinary how patient he is when rubbing , massaging and manipulating the sick himself in various ways . He’s far stronger than an orderly , and has the knack of allaying their embarrassments and positioning the people exactly as he needs them . There’s an old man who would make a superb St Jerome . A thin , tall , wiry , brown and wrinkled body with joints so outstandingly clear and expressive that it makes one sad not to have him as a model .
I can well imagine that Heyerdahl is delighted by such a payment . Now I must inform you that Pa visited me the first days that I was here , although very briefly and in great haste , and I wasn’t really able to talk about anything . I would rather he had visited at another time , when it could truly have been of more good for both of us . Now it was very strange for me , and seemed more or less like a dream — as does this whole business of lying here being ill .
 
I’ve seen no one apart from Sien , her and Pa , which is in fact all for the best , though the days are rather lonely and melancholy . Sometimes I can’t help thinking that life is now considerably more sombre and lonelier than , for example , when I first visited Mauve last winter . It gives me a stab of pain and an anxious feeling each time I think of it , even though I try to chuck the whole thought of it overboard as useless ballast .
I heard from the orderly that Breitner was discharged a few days ago .
I believe that here in this class the doctor gives shorter shrift than in the more expensive ones . So much the better .
Perhaps here they’re less hesitant about inflicting a little pain on the patients than in the higher wards , and more ready , for example , to stick a catheter in someone’s bladder without a lot of ‘good manners’ or compliments . Well , all the better in my view , and I repeat it’s as good here as in the 3rd-class waiting room . If only I could work! But I must take things as they are . I have a book by Dickens and my perspective books .
I hope you’ll write again . You know the address is:
Municipal hospital , Brouwersgracht
4th class . Ward 6 , No . 9
Adieu , a handshake in thought , and many thanks again for your loyal letter and the enclosure . I wish you well , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I believe that when Sien had to go I became too nervous and then broke down , but there are times when one can’t always remain cool-headed . She’s lying there so alone , and I would so like to go there because these will be frightening days for her .
