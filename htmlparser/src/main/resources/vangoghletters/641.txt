Letter|My dear old Bernard .
Perhaps you’ll be inclined to forgive me for not having replied to your letter straightaway , seeing that I’m attaching a small batch of croquis to this one .
In the croquis , The garden , there’s perhaps something like ‘the shaggy carpets of flowers and woven greenery’ of Crivelli or Virelli , doesn’t much matter . Ah , well — in any case I wanted to reply to your quotations with my pen , but not by writing words . Today , too , I don’t have much of a head for discussion ; I’m up to my ears in work .
Have made large pen drawings — 2 — an immense flat expanse of country — seen in bird’s-eye view from the top of a hill — vineyards , harvested fields of wheat , all of it multiplied endlessly , streaming away like the surface of a sea towards the horizon bounded by the hillocks of La Crau .
It does not look Japanese , and it’s actually the most Japanese thing that I’ve done .
 
A microscopic figure of a ploughman , a little train passing through the wheatfields ; that’s the only life there is in it . Listen , I passed – a few days after my arrival — that place with a painter friend .
There’s something that would be boring to do , he said . I said nothing myself , but I found that so astonishing that I didn’t even have the strength to give that idiot a piece of my mind . I go back there , go back , go back again — well , I’ve done two drawings of it — of that flat landscape in which there was nothing but . . . . . . . . . . the infinite . . . eternity .
Well — while I’m drawing along comes a chap who isn’t a painter but a soldier . I say , ‘Does it astonish you that I find that as beautiful as the sea?’ Now he knew the sea — that one . ‘No — it doesn’t astonish me’ — he says – ‘that you find that as beautiful as the sea — but I find it
  even more beautiful than the ocean because it’s inhabited . ’ Which of the spectators was more the artist , the first or the second , the painter or the soldier — I myself prefer that soldier’s eye . Isn’t that true?
Now it’s my turn to say to you , reply to me quickly this time by return of post — to let me know if you agree to make me some croquis of your Breton studies . I have a consignment that’s about to go off , and before it clears off I want to do at least another half a dozen subjects in pen croquis for you . Having few doubts that you will do it for yours , I’m getting down to work on my side , anyway , without even knowing if you want to do that . Now , I’ll send these croquis to my brother , to urge him to take something from them for our collection .
 
I’ve already written to him about that , anyway . But we’re working on something that leaves us absolutely without a sou .
The fact is that Gauguin — who has been very ill — is probably going to spend the coming winter with me here in the south . And there’s the fare , which is worrying us . Once here , well , two together spend less than one alone . All the more reason why I’d like to have some things by you here . Once Gauguin’s here , we’ll try to do something together in Marseille , and will probably exhibit there . Now I’d like to have some things by you too , although without making you lose opportunities for selling in Paris . In any case , I don’t believe I’m making you lose them by encouraging you to exchange croquis of painted studies between us . And as soon as I can , we’ll do another piece of business as well , but am quite hard up now . What I’m convinced of is that if we exhibit in Marseille , sooner or later Gauguin and I will encourage you to join us .
Thomas bought Anquetin’s study in the end — the peasant .
I shake your hand firmly , more soon , and
Ever yours ,
Vincent
