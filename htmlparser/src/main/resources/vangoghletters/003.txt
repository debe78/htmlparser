Letter|The Hague , January 1873
My dear Theo ,
I heard from home that you arrived safe and sound in Brussels , and that your first impression was good .
I understand completely how strange it will be in the beginning , but be of good heart , you’ll surely succeed . You must write to me soon about how things are going and how your boarding-house suits you .
I hope that the latter will be all right . Pa wrote that you’re good friends with Schmidt . Bravo , I think he’s a fine fellow , and one who’ll be sure to show you the ropes .
 
How pleasant those days at Christmas were , I think of them so often ; they’ll also long be remembered by you , as they were also your last days at home . You must write to me in particular about what kind of paintings you see and what you find beautiful .
I’m busy now at the beginning of the year . My new year began well , I was given a monthly rise of 10 guilders , so I now earn 50 guilders a month , and on top of that I received a 50-guilder bonus . Isn’t that wonderful? I now hope to be entirely self-supporting .
 
I’m really very happy that you’re also part of this firm . It’s such a fine firm , the longer one is part of it the more enthusiastic one becomes .
The beginning is perhaps more difficult than in other jobs , but keep your chin up and you’ll get along .
Do ask Schmidt what the ‘Album Corot . lithographies par Emile Vernier’ costs . We’ve been asked about it in the shop , and I know it’s in stock in Brussels .
The next time I write I’ll send you my portrait ; I had it taken last Sunday .
Have you been to the Palais Ducal yet?
  Do go when you get the chance .
How is Uncle Hein? I feel so sorry for him , and hope so much that he’ll get better . Give him and Aunt my warm regards .
Did Uncle Cent stop off at Brussels?
Well , old chap , keep well , all your acquaintances here send their regards and hope things will go well for you . Bid good-day to Schmidt and Eduard for me , and let me hear from you soon .
Adieu
Your loving brother
Vincent .
