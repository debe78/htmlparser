Letter|Sunday morning
My dear Theo ,
I’ve just received your very welcome letter and want to reply immediately , since today I’m having a bit of a rest anyway . I thank you for it , and for the enclosure and for one or two things you say in it .
And for your description of the scene with the workmen in Montmartre , which I found most interesting , because you give the colours as well so that I can see it — many thanks .
I’m glad you’re reading the book about Gavarni . I thought it very interesting , and have become doubly attached to G . because of it .
Paris and its surroundings may be beautiful , but we can’t complain here either . This week I painted something which I believe may give some idea of the impression of Scheveningen as we saw it when we walked there together . A large study of sand , sea , sky — a big sky of delicate grey and warm white through which an occasional spot of soft blue shines — the sand and the sea light — so that the whole becomes blond , though enlivened by the bold and distinctively coloured figures and pinks , which take on tone . The subject of the sketch I made of it is a pink weighing anchor . The horses stand ready to be hitched to the pink before pulling it into the sea . I enclose a scratch of it . I really laboured over it — I wish I’d painted it on panel or canvas . I tried to get more colour into it , namely depth , firmness of colour .
It certainly is curious how you and I often seem to have the same thoughts . Yesterday evening , for example , I came back with a study of the woods , and this week in particular , especially then , I was very absorbed in the question of depth of colour . And would have liked to discuss it with you , particularly in connection with the study I had made — and lo and behold , in your letter of this morning you happen to remark on how you were struck in Montmartre by the very pronounced colours , which nonetheless remained harmonious . I don’t know if it was exactly the same thing that struck us , but I’m absolutely sure you would also have felt what particularly struck me and probably seen it in the same way . I’ll begin by sending you a scratch of the subject and telling you what the problem was .
The woods are already getting really autumnal — there are colour effects which I only rarely see depicted in Dutch paintings .
 
Yesterday evening I was occupied with an area of woodland with a slight upward slope covered in rotting and dead beech leaves . The ground was lighter and darker red-brown , all the more so because of the cast shadows of trees that threw bands across , weaker or stronger , half blotted out . The problem , and I found it to be most difficult , was to get the depth of colour — the enormous strength and fixity of that area — and yet it was only while painting that I noticed how much light there still was in that darkness . To keep it light and yet keep the glow , the depth of that rich colour , for there’s no carpet imaginable as splendid as that deep brown-red in the glow of an autumnal evening sun , although tempered by the wood .
Out of the ground shoot young beech trees that catch the light on one side — are brilliantly green there — and the shaded side of those trunks a warm , strong black-green . Beyond these trunks , beyond the brown-red ground , is a sky , a very delicate blue-grey , warm — almost not blue — sparkling . And set against this is another hazy edge of greenness and a network of slender trunks and yellowish leaves . A few figures gathering wood move about like dark masses of mysterious shadows . The white cap of a woman who bends over to pick up a dry branch suddenly stands out against the deep red-brown of the ground . A skirt catches the light — a cast shadow falls — a dark silhouette of a fellow appears on top of the undergrowth against the brushwood fence . A white cap , bonnet , shoulder , bust of a woman set off against the sky . These figures — they’re large and full of poetry — appear in the half-light of the deep shadow tone like huge terracottas being made in a studio . I’m describing nature to you — to what extent I conveyed it in my sketch I’m not sure myself — but I do know that I was struck by the harmony of green , red , black , yellow , blue , brown , grey . It was very Degroux-like , an effect similar , for example , to that sketch of the conscript’s departure formerly in the Palais Ducal .
Painting it was hard graft . There are one and a half large tubes of white in the ground — yet that ground is very dark — in addition red , yellow , brown ochre , black , terra sienna , bistre , and the result is a red-brown that varies from bistre to deep wine-red and to pale , blond reddish . Then there are also mosses and an edge
  of fresh grass that catches the light and sparkles brightly and is very difficult to get . There at last you have a sketch which — whatever may be said about it — I maintain has some meaning , says something .
While making it I said to myself: let me not leave before there’s something of an autumn evening in it , something mysterious , something with seriousness in it .
However , because this effect doesn’t last , I had to paint quickly . The figures were done with a few vigorous strokes with a firm brush — in one go . I was struck by how firmly the slender trunks stood in the ground — I began them using a brush , but because of the ground , which was already impasted , one brushstroke simply disappeared . Then I squeezed roots and trunks into it from the tube , and modelled them a little with the brush . Yes , now they stand in it — shoot up out of it — stand firmly rooted in it . In a sense I’m glad that I’ve never learned how to paint . Probably then I would have learned to ignore effects like this . Now I say , no , that’s exactly what I want — if it’s not possible then it’s not possible — I want to try it even though I don’t know how it’s supposed to be done . I don’t know myself how I paint . I sit with a white board before the spot that strikes me — I look at what’s before my eyes — I say to myself , this white board must become something — I come back , dissatisfied — I put it aside , and after I’ve rested a little , feeling a kind of fear , I take a look at it — then I’m still dissatisfied — because I have that marvellous nature too much in mind for me to be satisfied — but still , I see in my work an echo of what struck me , I see that nature has told me something , has spoken to me and that I’ve written it down in shorthand . In my shorthand there may be words that are indecipherable — errors or gaps — yet something remains of what the wood or the beach or the figure said — and it isn’t a tame or conventional language which doesn’t stem from nature itself but from a studied manner or a system .
 
Herewith also a scratch from the dunes . Standing there were small bushes whose leaves are white on one side and dark green on the other , and which constantly move and sparkle . Behind them dark wood .
As you see , I’m immersing myself in painting with all my strength — I’m immersing myself in colour — I’ve held back from that until now , and don’t regret it . If I hadn’t drawn I would never have felt or tackled a figure that looks like an unfinished terracotta . But now , I feel I’m on the high seas — painting must proceed with all the strength that we can muster .
If I work on panel or canvas , the costs go up again — everything is so expensive — paint is expensive too , and is used up so quickly . Well , these are drawbacks that all painters face — we must see what’s possible . I know for sure that I have a feeling for colour that will develop more and more , that painting is in my very marrow . I appreciate it enormously that you support me so loyally and strongly . I think of you so often — I would so much like my work to be substantial , serious , manly , and for it to give you pleasure as soon as possible .
I want to bring one thing to your attention as important . Wouldn’t it be possible to get paint , panels , brushes , &amp ; c . for the net price? At present I have to pay the retail price . Are you in touch with Paillard or someone like that? If so , it seems to me it would work out considerably cheaper to buy paint , for example , in larger quantities , such as white , ochre , terra sienna , and we could come to an arrangement as to the money . It would of course be cheaper . Think about it , if you will . Good painting doesn’t consist in using a great deal of paint , but to give a ground true strength , to make a sky bright , sometimes one mustn’t worry about a tube more or less .
Sometimes the subject requires that one paints thinly , sometimes the material , the nature of the things , makes it self-evident that they must be impasted . At Mauve’s — who paints very soberly in comparison with J . Maris , and even more so in comparison with Millet or Jules Dupré — in the corners of the studio there are nevertheless cigar boxes with the remains of tubes as numerous as the empty bottles in the corners of rooms at a soirée or meal such as Zola describes , for example . Now , if this month a little extra is possible , that would be wonderful . If not , then not . I’ll work as far as I can . You enquire after my health , but how’s yours? I believe that my remedy could also be yours . Being outdoors , painting . I’m well . I’m still troubled when I’m tired , but it’s getting better rather than worse . I believe that it’s also beneficial that I live as frugally as possible , but painting is my chief remedy . I hope with all my heart that you have some happiness and will find much more .
Accept a handshake in thought , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
As you see , in the scratch of the seascape there’s a blond , soft effect , and in the woods a more sombre , serious mood . I’m glad that both of these exist in life .
