Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve just received a letter from home (please thank Pa for it , I hadn’t had the letter when I wrote) , and I gather you plan to leave Breda at 2 . 15 on Friday . If there’s any change in your travel plans , let me know , and I’ll meet your train . Because if you’re in a hurry we must make sure not to let slip any time when we can be together . I’m working on a painted sketch for potato grubbers . I hope it comes off . I’m longing to see you , have a pleasant time , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Look closely at the fields in Brabant , what they’re doing there . And try to take a look at the interior of a weaver’s cottage in the village to see whether they aren’t beautiful things .
