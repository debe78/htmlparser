Letter|My dear Theo ,
I thank you for your letter and the 50-franc note that was enclosed with it . About the Tanguy business , don’t get involved in it . Only I beg you not to risk the new paintings that are at his place , so take them back as a response to the fact that he presented you with an account and asked for a down payment . Bear in mind that you’re dealing with the Tanguy woman — and if not , if HE behaves like that then it’s the case that he’s dealing dishonestly towards me . Tanguy still has a study of mine that he thought he could sell . I owe him it , if it comes to it , but I don’t owe him a sou in money . To get into an argument about that is to argue with mère Tanguy , which no mortal should be obliged to do . According to them (the Tanguys) , Guillaumin , Monet , Gauguin , all owe them money ; is that true or not?? In any case , if they don’t pay , why should I pay? I regret having wished to get colours from him again to please him , he can expect that in future I won’t get any more from him . With mère Tanguy , who’s poisonous , it’s a question of doing it on the quiet — I beg you to take back my new paintings . And that’s enough .
 
Tanguy’s zinc white at 40 centimes is a little dearer than Tasset’s large tubes (at 1 . 50 francs) , which contain at least 4 times as much .
Leave Tanguy the study he has of Asnières — a bank of the Seine . It’s his , if it comes to it — but kick him out afterwards — and without mercy .
If you made a down payment — but that would be to acknowledge a debt that I dare deny . Never — so don’t let yourself be taken in . The only thing I actually owe is to Bing . In the sense that there are still 90 francs worth of Japanese prints on commission . But if we take into account that I’ve often sent people directly to Bing , it would be better that Bing leave us that , and if I was still there to deal with it , I’d wish to increase the stock so as to be able to do slightly more important business in them .
And if I don’t ask Bing for a commission , it’s precisely that I would bring it up in case of claims . That’s to tell you that other claims would probably have no merit .
At the moment I’m concentrating on doing something to enhance the value of my paintings . You know I have only one means of achieving that end — it’s to paint them .
 
But I say to myself that if I manage to do 50 studies at 100 francs this year I shall in a certain sense not have done a great injustice by eating and drinking as if that was a right . Now that’s a bit steep , because although at this moment I have about thirty painted studies , I don’t reckon them all at that price .
All the same , there must be some out of all of them . But — the costs of executing them make me very , very poor even so — I wouldn’t press the point if people didn’t come , like our friend(?) Tanguy , asking for down payments when the debt is dubious in the extreme . Whatever money you might have at your disposal for this purpose , well , I’d have the greatest possible need of it .
I go without many things — not that I consider that a misfortune , but I consider that my money that I’ll need in future depends to some extent on the vigour of my efforts at present .
They quibbled with me at the post office , saying that the drawings I was sending you were too big to be sent that way .
I have two large new ones . When there are 6 I’ll send them by rail , in a roll .
I say to myself that if the studies are hard to dry here in the heat , they’d be all the harder to dry at your place . And that’s making me delay the consignment .
I’ve scraped off one of the large painted studies . A Garden of Olives — with a blue and orange Christ figure , a yellow angel — a piece of red earth , green and blue hills . Olive trees with purple and crimson trunks , with grey green and blue foliage . Sky lemon yellow .
 
I scraped it off because I tell myself it’s wrong to do figures of that importance without a model .
Of course — it would be better in my opinion too if Gauguin came here — for that reason of the coming winter . Still no reply from Russell . That Boch is still staying with MacKnight , and he’s working hard , it seems . But I haven’t seen anything yet . He’s a lad whose outward appearance I like very much . Face like the blade of a razor , green eyes , and distinction with all that . MacKnight seems very coarse beside him .
After what you told me about him , I’m going to see him this afternoon . MacKnight has picked up a chancre from a fat woman where I was going at the same time , just by sheer luck I was careful — but what’s the use of being careful , since you can’t do anything and since after all , all’s always for the best in the best of worlds? I read that Bing’s holding a Japanese exhibition and publishing a magazine on Japanese art . Have you seen that? At times I find it terrible not to be able to get a whole lot more Japanese prints . Well , we ought to try to do them ourselves instead . Have you read Loti’s book , Madame Chrysanthème? Very interesting . I have to tell you exactly the same thing today as last Thursday , the end of the week will be very tight , if you can send the next letter a day or two earlier , so much the better .
 
Have you been able to find that book , A . Cassagne , ABCD du dessin? I really will need it .
Mourier should definitely buy one for himself . I’ll write to Russell again , while at the same time thinking I’d do better to wait for his reply . But I’ll write this evening anyway , and that’s just why I’ll go and see his friends MacKnight and Boch , to be able to talk about them and have an opportunity to say something to him before he replies to me .
If the other 4 drawings I have in my head are like the first two I have , then you’ll have the epitome of a really beautiful corner of Provence .
It’s good of Guillaumin to have come to have a look , I’m very sensitive about it , but in short , I’m unhappy with everything I’m doing . Why move around a lot? When I see the orchards again won’t I be more hardened , won’t it be like something new , a new attack , in the new season , on the same subject?
 
And the same throughout the year , for the harvest , for the vineyards , for everything .
I’d like to send you the 30 studies at this moment , so that it may perhaps help with the costs to be found in order for Gauguin to come . It’s very good , what Schuffenecker’s done . And père Thomas — he really ought to buy from me or from Gauguin for a hundred francs — then we’d be nearly there . What’s Bing’s exhibition like? If you happened to see their manager there , tell him I’m here and that I ask him to leave my stock alone , and that if I was there I’d go to more trouble for him . The Lautrec have just arrived ; I find them beautiful .
More soon , I’ll write to you again in the next few days — but don’t fall for the Tanguy woman’s trick , because it’s not fair and it upsets me that ère Tanguy should behave like that . You can be sure that if I owed him I would say so but there are other conditions , such as that I’ll never pay him in money and that he still has NO MORE THAN AN AMICABLE right to the paintings .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Just you watch , Bernard will have the same story with Tanguys , only worse .
