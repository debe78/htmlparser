Letter|My dear Theo ,
Here are the two photographs of the weavers . Next week I hope to send you two subjects from the decorations for Hermans .
You know well enough that your criticism , at least over the last 1 1/2 years , appears to me to be just a sort of vitriol . Don’t think that I don’t know that against that vitriol one must furnish oneself with a sort of hide that it can’t easily penetrate , and that if one is hardened to it , it doesn’t trouble one much — so — what do I care?
I also believe , moreover , that you mean well . So what more do you want?
I continue just to say this , that I maintain that it’s absolutely not only my fault if the money you give me produces a poor return not only for you , but also a poor return for me .
The former , that it produces a poor return for you , saddens me more than the latter , that it also produces a poor return for me .
It can get better , you’ll say — yes , but then not only I , but also you , will have to change a great deal .
I wanted to let you know that in the winter , perhaps as early as next month , I’m going away from here for a while — I’ve thought about Antwerp — I’ve thought about The Hague .
But in the last few days I’ve thought of something that’s possibly even better .
First of all , I want in any event to have a bit of city life , a bit of a change of scene , since
  I’ve been either in Drenthe or here in Nuenen for a full year and more . And I believe that this will be a beneficial change for me in general , for my mood , which hasn’t been nor could be as cheerful as I’d like , particularly recently .
Now look here — Stracké the sculptor lives in Den Bosch , he’s also the principal of a drawing academy there — I saw a terracotta by a pupil of his , and heard on that occasion that Stracké is definitely not ill-disposed or indifferent to anyone in this area who does something in art . That he has various models for the academy in Den Bosch , and that there are people he gives the opportunity to draw the nude or to model in clay . One probably has to pay the model oneself , though , but that’s not so very expensive , and moreover one has a good classroom for which one does not pay .
I’ll find out more about this , and then it’s not impossible that I might go to Stracké in the way that Breitner went to
  Cormon , say . This would be in the area and would also work out the cheapest .
I’ve bought a very fine work on anatomy , Anatomy for artists by John Marshall , which was expensive but which will also be of use to me all my life because it’s very good . What’s more , I also have what they use at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and what they use in Antwerp .
Things like that make large holes in my pocket , though . I tell you this solely to make you understand , for heaven’s sake , that if I haven’t paid Pa and Ma for being here at home it isn’t because I don’t want to pay but because I’ve incurred many expenses that for my part I simply don’t consider unnecessary .
The key to many things is a thorough knowledge of the human body , but it definitely costs money to learn it . And I think moreover that colour , that chiaroscuro , that perspective , that tone , that drawing , everything in short — certainly also have fixed laws that one must and can study like chemistry or algebra .
This is by no means the easiest view of things , and anyone who says — oh , it must all come naturally — is making light of it .
If that were enough — — But it’s not enough , because however much one knows instinctively , it’s precisely then that one must redouble one’s efforts , in my view , to get from instinct to REASON .
You mustn’t imagine that I earned anything from that work for Hermans — the first day I got two invoices for the stretchers , canvases and a number of tubes of paint that amounted to more than I’d received from him to pay them straightaway .
 
I told him that I didn’t want to leave those bills outstanding , and did he want to put them in his name or would he give me something in advance . Oh no , he said , just leave them , they don´t have to be paid straightaway . I said — yes , they do , they have to be paid straightaway . Then he gave me 25 guilders .
Then I had all my expenses for models (not counting my time , effort &amp ; c . ) , but since then I haven’t seen any more money from him , which I also haven’t asked for . On the contrary — because he liked my work from first to last , if need be I consider I’ve already been paid . Since , moreover , the canvases remain my property and it’s up to me what I spend on them .
But enough , since those strainers , canvases &amp ; c . I’ve certainly had 20 guilders in expenses , perhaps even more , but haven’t even got it back yet . Only the man is happy , and pleased with me . Then is it a good policy to ask for money? To my mind , precisely WHEN PEOPLE ARE HAPPY , one should take care to reduce one’s price rather than raise it .
Particularly when , after all , the sum isn’t such that receiving it or not makes a great deal of difference . If I get by , perhaps I’ll do it precisely by working more cheaply than others and by making it easier for the art lovers .
Well , Hermans is very good and a man to keep in with , and he’s certainly rich — but — has always been tight-fisted rather than generous . Something very different from an actual miser , but all the same — I’m earning less (a whole lot less) than nothing .
But having noticed this , I’m very amicable and obliging towards him . I have a very pleasant , congenial friend in him , and it’s certainly striking to see a man of 60 doing his best to learn to paint with the same freshness of enthusiasm as if he were 20 . What he does isn’t beautiful , but he works hard and has already copied 4 of my 6 with a different sentiment , and his has something medieval , something of Peasant Bruegel about it .
 
You once said to me that I would always be isolated . I don’t believe it — you’re decidedly mistaken in my character . And for my part I have absolutely no intention of becoming less passionate in ideas or in life than I am . By no means — if I meet with a rebuff , even if I’m often mistaken — often wrong — that — it’s all very well as far as it goes — fundamentally , though , I’m not wrong .
It’s neither the best paintings nor the best people — in which there are no errors or bias .
And again , although these may seem to be toothless times , they aren’t really .
I also definitely deny that my assertion that certain parties are just as strongly opposed to each other in 84 as they were in 48 is exaggerated .
It’s something other than that ditch of yours , that I assure you — I’m speaking here of the parties , rather than specifically of you and me — but you and I also belong somewhere , stand either on the right or on the left , don’t we , whether or not we’re aware of it . For my part , I always have a bias — then , if you will and if you think you can do it , it’s up to you to stand neither on the right nor on the left — I take the liberty of doubting most strongly the feasibility of doing so .
And above all the practical use .
 
I’ve had a relatively good letter from Utrecht , that ’s recovered to the extent that she can go to The Hague for a while , where she has to be for business . But I’m still far from easy about it . The tone of her letters is much more self-confident , much more correct and less prejudiced than when I first knew her . Something also of the complaint of a bird whose nest has been robbed — she isn’t as angry about society as I am , perhaps , but nonetheless she does see in it the ‘naughty boys who rob nests’ — and who take pleasure in it and laugh .
Pa will not accept the call , that’s certain .
But a piece of news these days is that the in Helvoirt has died and so the parish is vacant . I consider it very likely that now they’d want to have Pa back there again , and at least the family in Helvoirt will sound Pa out about it . But since it was only the day before yesterday that the good minister dropped dead , I know nothing more about whether or not they’ll call Pa . But would think it very likely .
Listen , about what I call a barricade and you a little ditch , there’s simply an old society that to my mind is going under through its own fault — there’s a new society that has come into being and grown , and will go on .
In short , there is what emanates from revolutionary and what emanates from anti-revolutionary principles .
Now I ask you whether you yourself haven’t often noted that the policy of hovering between the old and the new isn’t tenable . Just think about that .
Sooner or later it ends with one openly standing either on the right or on the left .
It isn’t a little ditch . And once more , then it was 48 , now it’s 84 — then there was a barricade of paving-stones — now not of paving-stones , but a barricade as regards the irreconcilability of old and new — oh , that is still there , as much , certainly , in 84 as in 48 .
Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
