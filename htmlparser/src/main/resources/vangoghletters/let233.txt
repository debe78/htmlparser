Letter|My dear brother,
Today or tomorrow, being the 1st of June, I promised to pay my 5 guilders rent of studio for the month of April + 7.50 guilders for last month — makes 12.50 guilders.
But not having up to now received any letter of yours since that of May 12th I have nothing to pay him his twelve guilders and 50 c with. The man will surely not give me any longer delay but they can immediately sell my furniture publicly. Whatever may be your opinion concerning the things I told you — do not let it come to this scandal. My drawings for C.M. are ready but I shan’t be able to get that money early enough. I say again — let us at all events avoid irregularity and public scandal and talk or write calmly on the subject till we know what ought to be done. So I hope you’ll send me what I so greatly want, and write. I work day and night and have a small drawing ready for you which I’ll send bye and bye. I have no more money for a stamp, excuse the postcard, and believe me
Yours truly,
Vincent
