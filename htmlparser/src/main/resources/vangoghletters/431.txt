Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
It’s hard to call it very cordial that you haven’t even dropped me a line in all this time . Assuming that you’ll also think more or less the same yourself , however , this subject isn’t under discussion right now .
Something else is that my is doing much better than could have been expected at first . And the now dares to give us an assurance that she’ll be better in about 3 months .
I’ve occasionally thought about what we agreed , roughly that I was to have sent you a few watercolours this winter . But because I heard nothing whatsoever from you I didn’t feel at all enthusiastic about it , to put it frankly . So nothing came of it — although I made some .
I’ve mostly been painting these last few weeks — the weavers — toiled away at it quite a bit .
And in these recent mild days painted outside in the fields , a little peasant cemetery .
Then 5 pen drawings of weavers .
 
I haven’t got much more in the way of woodcuts this winter — even so , one very fine print by O’Kelly , Irish emigrants — and a cotton spinning mill by Emslie , and then the print from the Xmas issue of The Graphic , For those in peril upon the sea .
Do you know the poems of Jules Breton? I re-read them recently at the same time as another little volume of French verse by François Coppée , Les humbles and Promenades et intérieurs .
Coppée’s really very beautiful too . Character sketches of workers — the demi-monde , too , in which there’s a great deal of sentiment . A very great deal .
Have you been working so hard on your Dominican monk , or what was the reason that you haven’t written?
Regards .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
P . S . : I’ve also got hold of a spinning wheel here .
