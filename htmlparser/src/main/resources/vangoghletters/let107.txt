My dear Uncle ,
When Pa was here recently he told me that you had asked whether Theo and I could come and see you some day .
I long so much to see and talk to you and Aunt again , and so I’d like to ask if it would be convenient for you if Theo and I came next Sunday with the first train from The Hague , and stayed with you until the afternoon or evening .
Theo has to go on a trip soon , and if we don’t do it now it may not be possible for a long time .
It was a wonderful day when Pa was here recently ; we took a walk together and also went to the museum to see the paintings by Scheffer . I’m doing well here , at the beginning of the year there’s a lot of work in the shop , so I’m there until 12 or 1 o’clock at night .
I’m happy to be back in Holland , only I loved the work over there – even with all the trouble and deep disappointment connected with it – and continue to do so , and the disappointment and , for once , relative failure make me deeply attached to it .
 
It’s wonderful that Anna has found another situation straightaway ; I only hope it will be to her liking .
If it’s all right with you that Theo and I come next Sunday , please write a postcard to one of us , and believe me meanwhile , after warm regards to and Aunt
Your loving nephew
Vincent
I would have written to you about this earlier if Pa hadn’t asked me only yesterday to go next Sunday .
