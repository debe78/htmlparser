Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
I need to tell you again that the visit to you raised my spirits enormously . I intend to make a start on some larger compositions too , and I’ve already started on one of them .
That is peat diggers in the dunes . About 1 metre by 1/2 metre .
Do you recall my telling you that there was such a beautiful sight there in the dunes? It looks a little like the raising of a barricade . As soon as I left you I started work , for it was already fairly ripe in my head . Just as I’ve already thought a lot about some other compositions , and already have studies for them too .
If I hadn’t had the money from you , however , I wouldn’t have been able to do this , for example , at this time .
I’ve had a wooden passe-partout made like yours but no frame . I’m thinking of giving the passe-partout , unpainted as yet , the colour of walnut . Like your frame . The effect is pleasing when one encloses the drawing and as soon as I saw your drawings I decided to have a similar passe-partout .
 
In Harper’s Weekly I found an illustration by Reinhart , by far the best I’ve seen by him up to now , ‘Washed ashore’ .
A body has been washed up , a man is kneeling beside it to see who it is , a few fishermen and women give information about the shipwreck victim to a gendarme . So it looks somewhat like Victim of a shipwreck that you have , but the drawing by R . has something of Régamey , for example . It’s a very fine print .
What beautiful things there are to be found , don’t you think? I’ve now sketched the drawing Peat diggers in charcoal , natural chalk and autographic ink . I haven’t yet used the strongest strengths of printer’s ink on it .
So it doesn’t yet look as forceful as I imagine it could be . The only thing I have against charcoal is that it wipes off so easily ; one loses things one has found because of this wiping off unless one works very carefully .
And I feel a need not to have to be all that careful .
I have a few plans for large drawings , my dear friend , for which you might perhaps have some sympathy .
I wish you had read Les misérables , then I would be better able to discuss it with you , for you might perhaps be struck by the same things that keep coming into my mind . That wouldn’t surprise me .
  I knew that book long ago , but many things from it keep coming to mind now that I’ve read it again .
Both you and I learned some history at school , but if you’re like me that’s not enough for you , as well as being too dry and too conventional .
Now for my part I’d wish to have a clear view of the period from 1770 , say , to the present . The French Revolution is the greatest modern event on which everything turns , in the present age too .
When I read something like Dickens’s London and Paris (Tale of two cities) and reflect on it , I believe one could choose such splendid subjects for drawings from that period of the Revolution . Not directly related to actual history so much as to incidents of ordinary life and the look of things as they were in the past . Take the drawing by Howard Pyle and that other one by Abbey that I showed you recently , Xmas in old New York , Xmas in old Virginia .
Now , starting in those days and letting one’s thoughts wander up to today , one surveys a period in which everything has changed . And several moments are particularly interesting . And one finds them described so compellingly and so thoroughly in various French and English books that it becomes possible to picture the things of the past clearly .
 
Dickens , who usually described his own times , couldn’t help writing the Tale of two cities , and one sees repeatedly in his work that he inserts descriptions from earlier days , for instance a description of the London streets before there were street-lamps .
Question: could one find Dutch subjects from , say , the time when the first street-lamps were put up or from before they existed?
Just imagine a pew or a funeral , say , from the year 1815 . A removal , a promenade , a street on a winter’s day from that period or a little later .
In Les misérables , although it deals with a later period , I find what I am seeking , aspects of the past that stimulate me to imagine how things looked in the age of my great-grandfather , or no further back than my grandfather even . Quatre-vingt-treize by Hugo was the one that was illustrated by all The Graphic draughtsmen together . Caldecott also does it so truly .
I’d like to see what impression Quatre-vingt-treize and Les misérables made on you . I don’t doubt for a moment that you’d find them beautiful . When I visited you I saw a few parts of the city which I imagined to myself enlivened by figures from ancient times . Well , we’ll probably talk about drawings from an earlier era another time . I hope it turns out that , as you said , you come here again this summer . It isn’t impossible that my brother from Paris may also visit you this summer . I would like him to see your work again and I would like us to come to you together while he’s here .
With a handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
