Letter|My dear Theo
You’ll probably be back in Paris when this letter arrives . I wish you and your lots of happiness .
Thanks very much for your kind letter and for the 100-franc note it contained .
Out of the 65 francs which I owe him , I’ve paid my only 25 francs , having had to pay 3 months’ rent in advance on a room where I shan’t live but where I’ve stored my furniture , and having in addition had around ten francs in various removal expenses &amp ; c .
Then , since my clothes were in not too brilliant a state – so that when I went out into the street it became necessary to have something new – I took a 35-franc suit and 4 francs for 6 pairs of socks .
  Thus I have only a few francs left out of the note , and at the end of the month I must pay the again , although we could make him wait a few days , more or less . At the hospital , after having settled the bill up to today , there’s still almost enough for the rest of the month from the money I still have on deposit there .
At the end of the month I’d still wish to go to the mental hospital at St-Rémy or another institution of that kind , which Mr Salles has told me about .
Forgive me for not going into details to weigh up the pros and the cons of such a course of action .
 
It would strain my mind a great deal to talk about it .
It will , I hope , suffice to say that I feel decidedly incapable of starting to take a new studio again and living there alone , here in Arles or elsewhere – it comes down to the same thing – for the moment – I’ve nevertheless tried to make up my mind to begin again – for the moment not possible . I’d be afraid of losing the faculty of working , which is coming back to me now , by forcing myself to have a studio , and also having all the other responsibilities on my back .
And for the time being I wish to remain confined , as much for my own tranquillity as for that of others .
What consoles me a little is that I’m beginning to consider madness as an illness like any other and accept the thing as it is , while during the actual crises
  it seemed to me that everything I was imagining was reality . Anyway , in fact I don’t want to think or talk about it . Excuse the explanations – but I ask you , and Messrs Salles and Rey , to act so that at the end of the month or the beginning of the month of May I may go there as a confined boarder .
Beginning again this painter’s life I’ve led up to now , isolated in the studio sometimes , and without any other source of entertainment than to go to a café or a restaurant with all the criticism of the neighbours &amp ; c . , I can’t do it . Going to live with another person , even another artist – difficult – very difficult – one takes too great a responsibility upon oneself . I dare not even think of it .
Anyhow , let’s begin with 3 months , afterwards we’ll see . Now the cost of board must be around 80 francs and I’ll do a little painting and drawing . Without putting as much fury into it as the other year .
  Don’t get upset about all this .
So there you have it , these days have been sad , moving house , transporting all my furniture , packing up the canvases which I’ll send you , but above all it seemed sad to me that all that had been given to me by you with so much brotherly affection , and that for so many years , it was however you alone who supported me , and then to be obliged to come back to tell you all this sad story . . . but it’s difficult for me to express that as I felt it .
The kindness you have had for me isn’t lost , since you have had it and you still have it , so even if the material results should be nil , you still have that all the more , but I can’t say that as I felt it .
Now you well understand that if alcohol was certainly one of the great causes of my madness , then it came very slowly and would go away slowly too , should it go , of course . Or if it comes from smoking , same thing .
 
But I would hope only that it – this recovery . . . The frightful superstition of certain people on the subject of alcohol , so that they prevail upon themselves never to drink or smoke . We’re already advised not to lie or steal and not to commit other great or small crimes , and it becomes too complicated if it was absolutely indispensable not to possess anything but virtues in a society in which we’re very indubitably rooted , be it good or bad .
I assure you that these strange days in which many things seem odd to me because my brain is shaken up , I don’t hate père Pangloss in all of this .
But you’ll do me a service by tackling the question forthrightly with Mr Salles and Mr Rey .
 
It would seem to me that with a boarding cost of around seventy-five francs a month there must be a way of confining me such that I have all I need .
Then I’d very much wish , if the thing is possible , to be able to go out in the daytime to go and draw or paint outside . Seeing as I go out here every day now , and I think that may continue .
I warn you that by paying more I’d be less happy . The company of the other sick people , you understand , isn’t at all disagreeable to me , on the contrary it distracts me .
Ordinary food suits me perfectly well , especially if , like here , I could be given a little more wine than usual down there , half a litre instead of a quarter , for example .
 
But a separate apartment , it remains to be seen what the rules of an institution like that will be . Be aware that Rey is overburdened with work , overburdened . If he or Mr Salles writes to you , it’s better to do exactly what they say .
Anyway , my dear fellow , we must accept it , the illnesses of our time , all in all it’s only fair that having lived for years in relatively good health , sooner or later we have our share of them . As for me , you’ll feel a little that I wouldn’t exactly have chosen madness if there had been a choice , but once one has something like that one can’t catch it any more . However , in addition there will still perhaps be the consolation of being able to continue to work on some painting a little . What will you do so as not to say to your wife either too many good or too many bad things about Paris and of a heap of things? Do you feel in advance completely able to keep exactly the right measure always , from every point of view?
 
I shake your hand heartily in thought , I don’t know if I’ll write to you very , very often , because all my days aren’t clear enough to write somewhat logically . All your kindnesses for me , I’ve found them greater than ever today .
I can’t tell you it as I feel it , but I assure you that that kindness has been of great worth , and if you don’t see its results , my dear brother , don’t be upset about it , you will still have your kindness . Only transfer this affection onto your as much as possible .
And if we correspond a little less you’ll see that if she is as I think she is , she will console you . That’s what I hope .
Rey is a really good fellow , terribly hard-working , always at the daily grind . What people today’s doctors are!
 
If you see Gauguin or if you write to him , give him my kind regards .
I’ll be very happy to have a little news of what you say about Mother and Sister and whether they’re well , tell them to take my story , my word , as a thing they mustn’t upset themselves about excessively , for I’m relatively unfortunate , but in spite of that , after all , I perhaps still have some almost ordinary years ahead of me: it’s an illness like any other , and currently almost all those we know among our friends have something . So is it worth talking about? I regret causing trouble to Mr Salles , to Rey , especially also to you , but what can one do – the mind isn’t steady enough to begin again like before – so it’s a matter of no longer causing scenes in public , and naturally being a little calmer now , I feel completely that I was in an unhealthy state , mentally and physically . And people were kind to me then , those I remember and the rest , anyhow I’ve caused anxiety , and if I’d been in a normal state all of this wouldn’t have happened in that way . Adieu , write when you can .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
