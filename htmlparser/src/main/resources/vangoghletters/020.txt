Dear Caroline and Willem ,
My hearty congratulations .
I imagine you will have been disappointed not to have heard from me sooner , but that’s like me , and you surely know that I mean well . Now you must render good for evil , however , and write to me directly about how things are going .
Now I have a piece of news for you ; our Anna will perhaps be coming here . You can imagine how wonderful that would be for me , but it’s almost too good to be true . Well , we’ll just have to wait and see . If she comes , it will probably be in May ,
  and perhaps it could be arranged for me to come and fetch her .
I’d like so much to get to know her better than I do , for in the last few years we’ve actually seen very little of each other , and we only half know each other .
I wish you both the best , many regards to everyone in the Poten , and if someone or other asks after me . Have you kept up your acquaintance with the Tersteeg family?
Yours truly ,
Vincent
