Letter|My dear Theo ,
Gauguin and I thank you very much for sending 100 francs , and also for your letter .
Gauguin is very happy that you like his consignment from Brittany , and that others who’ve seen it have liked it too .
At the moment he’s working on some women in a vineyard , entirely from memory , but if he doesn’t spoil it or leave it there unfinished it will be very fine and very strange . Also a painting of the same night café that I too have painted .
I’ve done two canvases of a leaf-fall , which Gauguin liked I think , and am now working on a vineyard , all purple and yellow .
Then I have an Arlésienne at last , a figure (no . 30 canvas) knocked off in one hour , background pale lemon — the face grey — the clothing dark dark dark , just unmixed Prussian blue . She’s leaning on a green table and is sitting in a wooden armchair — coloured orange .
Gauguin has bought a chest of drawers for the house , various household utensils and 20 metres of very strong canvas , a whole lot of things we needed , which it was more convenient to have anyway . Only we’ve made a note of all that he paid , which comes to nearly 100 francs , which we’d pay him back at New Year , or in the month of March for example , and then the chest of drawers &amp ; c . would belong to us of course .
I consider this quite right in fact , since he intends to put some money aside when he sells .
  Up to the moment (let’s say in a year) when he’ll have enough to risk a second trip to Martinique .
We’re working a great deal , and our life together is going very well .
I’m very happy to know that you’re not alone in the apartment .
De Haan’s drawings are very fine , I like them a lot . Now doing that with colour , arriving at the same degree of expression without resorting to black and white chiaroscuro , my goodness , that’s not easy . And he’ll even arrive at another type of drawing if he carries out his plan of passing through Impressionism like a school , regarding his new attempts at colour absolutely as studies . But as I see it he’s right several times over to do all that .
Only there are several people who call themselves Impressionists who don’t have his knowledge of the figure , and it’s precisely that , that knowledge of the figure , that will later come back up to the surface and that he’ll always benefit from . I very much want to get to know them one day , De Haan and Isaäcson . If ever they came here , Gauguin would certainly say to them: go to Java and do some Impressionism . Because Gauguin , while he works hard here , always has a nostalgic longing
  for hot countries . And there you are , it’s undeniable that if one came to Java , for example , with the preoccupation to work there with colour , one would see a heap , a whole heap , of new things . Then in those brighter countries under the stronger sun , the shaded parts as well as the shadow cast by objects and figures become completely different , and the coloration is so intense that one’s tempted quite simply to suppress it . That’s already happening here . Anyway , I won’t press the point about the importance of the question of tropical painting , De Haan and Isaäcson , I’m already sure , will sense its importance .
In any case , to come here at some time or another would do them no harm , they’ll certainly find interesting things .
Gauguin and I are going to dine at home today , and we feel sure and certain that we will manage this as often as it seems preferable or cheaper to us .
So as not to delay this letter I’ll finish it for today . I hope to write to you again soon .
Your arrangement for the money is absolutely fine .
I think that you’d like the leaf-fall that I’ve done .
It’s lilac poplar trunks cut by the frame where the leaves begin .
These tree-trunks , like pillars , line an avenue where old Roman tombs coloured lilac-blue are lined up to right and left . Now the ground is covered as if by a carpet with a thick layer of orange and yellow leaves
  — fallen . Some are still falling , like snowflakes .
And in the avenue dark figurines of lovers . The top of the painting is a very green meadow and no sky , or almost none .
The second canvas is the same avenue but with an old fellow and a fat woman , round as a ball .
But if only you’d been with us on Sunday! We saw a red vineyard , completely red like red wine . In the distance it became yellow , and then a green sky with a sun , fields violet and sparkling yellow here and there after the rain in which the setting sun was reflected .
We shake your hand firmly in thought , and more soon , I’ll write to you again as soon as I can , and also to our Dutchmen .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
