Letter|My dear Theo ,
Christien had a lot of cramp &amp ; c . , and so it seemed to me best for her to go to Leiden again to find out exactly what was wrong .
She went there and came back again . Everything is all right , thank God — but , as you know , she had an operation in March and has now been examined again . She needs care and must continue taking tonics — and if possible a few more baths as well , but there’s no problem and she has every chance of coming through it safely .
In March the professor couldn’t say exactly when she’d give birth , but thought it would be the end of May or beginning of June . Now he says it will probably be well into June , and he has altered her admission note for the hospital to mid-June . This time he asked her at length about who she was with , and because of what he said about that I’m now quite certain of what I thought before: that she’d collapse if she had to go back onto the streets , and that it was high
  time help came last winter when I met her . So I couldn’t consider leaving her , as I wrote to you earlier , for in the circumstances that would be a vile trick on my part .
The doctor thought she was better than in March . The is healthy and he has given her instructions about feeding &amp ; c . , so I won’t be completely in the dark . The linen for the child is ready too — the essentials .
I am faced here not by an illusion or abstraction but by reality , which requires firm action . In the circumstances I can see no better course than to marry her , neither for her nor for myself . As I wrote to you , I hadn’t expected the gentle tone of your letter of 13 May and the preceding one . I had cherished no
  illusions , and thought that you would have completely condemned my actions and withdrawn your help . And still I hardly dare hope that your help will continue , because I know that in the eyes of most people of your class such an action is regarded , I believe , as a capital offence leading to some form of banishment .
So I’m really looking forward to your next letter , and to knowing if you’ve received the drawings . But I’m not yet deluding myself about this .
It’s just that I wouldn’t be honest if I said anything to you other than: it’s my firm intention to marry her as soon as possible . The reasons you give aren’t weighty enough to make me change my mind , although in one or two of your remarks there is much that , particularly on its own , is wholly or partly true .
Now , to tell you the truth , a little more is actually needed this month , although I
  have paid for bread up to 1 June and have got in things like coffee &amp ; c .
If you tell me there’s no difficulty , as I thought there was , I really hope , of course , to get to work on C . M . ’s order , and have done the studies for it . I’ll need another 3 weeks , though , to finish the 6 drawings , for to have 6 good ones I’ll have to do more than 6 , on top of what I’ve already done . I don’t know what I’ll get for it , but I’ll do my best and so I hope to receive it in June .
If there’s anything good — after all — in my behaviour towards Christien , I believe it’s more to your credit than to mine , since I have been and am merely the instrument for doing it , but would have been powerless without your help . The money you’ve sent has helped me to get on with drawing and , more importantly , saved the life of Christien and the up to now . In a sense , though , I’m guilty if you should consider it an abuse of trust , but I hope you won’t consider it so .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
