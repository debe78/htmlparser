Letter|My dear Theo ,
Would it surprise you very much if — let’s suppose the people at home intend to move between March and May next — would it surprise you very much if before that time — something were to happen to Ma? This thought sometimes occurs to me when I go there . It seems to me that there’s been a change recently . ‘Getting old’ is such a singular thing , and there are certainly a lot of instances where the wife doesn’t survive the husband very long . The change I’ve observed is that every so often Ma is much more lucid in her thinking , whereas in the last few months she has had long periods when it seemed to be rather clouded — which is really not to be wondered at . There’s been something harried about her for a while — as a result — I can well imagine — of the emptiness and feeling alone . Well — it struck me — that she’s become very calm and very composed — and something resolute has taken the place of fretting . There’s nothing more to see .
 
I don’t consider it impossible — that death could also come to her unexpectedly and gently , much as with Pa and for similar reason .
Since it struck me — and because Wil said when I spoke to her about it that she’d also noticed that Ma had changed rather a lot and that she too was anxious about it — I’m just writing to you about it .
Otherwise , one would say , Ma looks very well . But there’s a certain something that makes me think of what I’m telling you . If Ma goes on a trip to Anna , to Amsterdam , to Cor before long — it seems to me that can’t do any harm , particularly since she seems to be set on it and is looking forward to seeing them all again . But it could well be that she herself has a presentiment that it will at the same time be a leave-taking .
 
I had to pay my rent this month , and at the same time gave notice on my studio come May . The drawback to which is that because of the neighbours , as you know , I really lack privacy , and I observe that the people are still afraid of the — although perhaps he wouldn’t meddle in things any more . Still , given that there’s been trouble , the most straightforward thing is to make a change .
What I did most recently is a rather large thing of an old mill on the bare heath , a dark silhouette against an evening sky .
It goes without saying that I’d telegraph you if there were something at home .
Now it’s an uneasiness that I feel — but then to an extent that I’m telling you about it . Since Ma still goes to see Van de Loo from time to time , he would tell us if there were anything to tell . But were it to be the same sort of death as Pa’s , that’s to say , sudden , it’s something that can just as easily
  happen in a few days as in a few years . So — who can say? If the lucidity and calm last , for my part I expect a crisis after the trip , in other words before long — and a death without much struggle . But — it sometimes happens that the mind becomes rather clouded , then it drags on , and in that case there could still be much suffering and worry to struggle through . Think about this , whether I might be wrong in suggesting these two possibilities , either quickly without suffering , or the other . Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
I’ll just say again , so that you know what I’m basing this on , I didn’t see anything particular apart from this return of serenity from time to time , and that Ma looks well , considering . Rather too well , even , so that for my part I have my doubts .
