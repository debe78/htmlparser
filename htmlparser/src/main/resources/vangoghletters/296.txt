Letter|My dear Theo ,
Before the year ends , I feel a need to thank you again for all your help and friendship . I’ve sent you almost nothing for a considerable time , but I’m saving up for when you come some day .
I’m sorry that I haven’t managed to make a saleable drawing this year — I really don’t know why it is that I haven’t managed this .
I wish you were in the studio once more . I believe I wrote to you recently that at present I’m occupied with large heads because I felt I needed to study the structure of a skull and the composition of a physiognomy more intimately .
The work is most absorbing , and the other day I found some things that I had long looked for in vain . Anyway , you’ll see everything when you come .
The past few days I’ve had a constant , troublesome toothache that sometimes affects my right eye and ear , and may perhaps involve the nerves too . One becomes indifferent to many things when one has toothache , but it’s curious that Daumier’s drawings , for example , are so striking that one almost forgets about the toothache . I have two more sheets by him , ‘Excursion train’ ,
  passengers with pale faces and black coats in raw weather who get to the platform too late . Women with howling infants between them .
Do you know the little book Croquis à la plume written by the draughtsman Henry Monnier (who invented Mr Prudhomme)? In it I read a ‘journey by diligence’ , amazingly true to life .
You’ll still be busy with your inventory and I shan’t hold you up . I heartily wish you the very best in the New Year .
Will we have more luck making saleable drawings in the new year , or finding work for an illustrated magazine , say?
I continue to believe one thing: wrestling with nature is not working in vain , and though I don’t know what the result will be , there will be a result .
I do wish you were in the studio again , not because I can’t make progress or don’t know what to do , but mainly because I’m so afraid that you may think I’m not making progress . And although I can’t show you a definitive result as yet , you would see that it’s gradually developing . And you would see that I’m searching for a great thing .
 
I agree entirely with what you wrote recently , ‘there comes a time when one has mastered drawing to the degree that the format becomes immaterial and one has the proportions in one’s head , so that one can work just as well on a large or a small scale . ’
Not only do I agree about that , but on top of that I believe that one can and must raise oneself to a level where one has mastered composition , effects , chiaroscuro to the extent that one can master the most diverse themes and subjects in the field one has chosen — such as today doing a 3rd-class waiting room , tomorrow a rainy day in a poor neighbourhood , another time an almshouse for old men , then a pub or a soup kitchen .
I haven’t got that far yet , but perhaps it’s a long process precisely because I search for the root or origin of many things at the same time .
Thanks for all your loyal friendship , old chap , which I again experienced the whole year long . May I , for my part , be able to give you some pleasure in turn . One day I’ll succeed in that . In thought a handshake , write again when you can find a moment — best wishes once more , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
