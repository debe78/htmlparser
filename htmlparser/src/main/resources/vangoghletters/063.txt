Welwyn , 19 Dec . 1875 .
Dear Vincent and Theo ,
My heartfelt thanks to you both for your last letters , which we were very glad to receive .
How wonderful it will be at home at Christmas . It’s been very cold here , but now it’s very mild . Theo , how awful about your leg , is it now completely better? We’ll
  probably have a Christmas tree . Our holiday begins on Thursday . And now , goodbye dear Vincent and Theo , I wish you both a very merry Christmas .
Yours , your loving sister
Wil .
P . S . I thank you for what you sent , I was very glad to get it .
