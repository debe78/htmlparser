Letter|My dear Theo ,
Just wanted to drop you a line while you’re in London . I thank you for your last letter and enclosed 150 francs . Would really like to go for a walk with you again there in London , preferably in real London weather , though , when the city has very melancholy aspects , particularly in certain old areas by the river — but at the same time has an extraordinarily poignant character .
Which some present-day English artists have started to make , after having learned to see and paint from the French .
But , unfortunately , it’s difficult to see that part of English art that’s actually the most interesting to you and to me . The majority of the paintings in the exhibitions are usually not appealing . Yet I hope , though , that you’ll come across something here and there that will enable you to understand how I , for my part , always keep thinking about some English paintings — for instance , Chill October by Millais — for instance , the drawings by Fred Walker and Pinwell . Look out for the Hobbema in the National Gallery — you certainly won’t forget to look at a couple of very fine Constable there (Cornfield) and also in South Kensington (where that farm is , Valley farm) . I’m very curious as to what will have struck you most and what you’ll have seen there .
 
Last week I was in the fields every day during the wheat harvest — of which I’ve made a composition .
[sketch A]
I made this for in Eindhoven who wants to decorate a dining room . He wanted to do it with compositions of various saints . I suggested he consider whether 6 scenes from the peasant life of the Meijerij — at the same time symbolizing the 4 seasons — might not whet the appetites of the good folk who would have to sit at table there more than the above-mentioned mystical personages . Well , the man warmed to the idea after visiting the studio .
But wants to paint those panels himself , and will that work? (However , I was to design and paint the compositions on a reduced scale . )
He’s a man I want to remain on good terms with if possible — a former goldsmith who has amassed and sold a very considerable collection of antiques no fewer than 3 times . Is now rich and has built a house that
  he’s filled with antiques again , and furnished with some very fine oak chests &amp ; c . He decorates the ceilings and walls himself , and really well sometimes .
But specifically wants painting in the dining room , and has started painting 12 panels of flowers .
That leaves 6 panels across the width , and for those I gave him provisional plans for sower — ploughman — shepherd — wheat harvest — potato harvest — ox-cart in the snow . But I don’t know whether it’ll come to anything — because I haven’t got a definite agreement from him . Only , he’s taken with this first panel as well as with my little sketches for the other subjects .
I’m really looking forward to your arrival . I’m still pleased to be here — I miss some things from time to time , but the work absorbs me enough .
Well — give my regards to Mr Obach if you run into him .
When you come here you’ll find all the peasants busy ploughing — and sowing spurrey — or — it will just be coming to an end then . I’ve seen magnificent sunsets over the stubble fields . Goodbye for now .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
