Letter|My dear Theo ,
It’s probable that I’ll have news from you tomorrow morning , but this evening I have time to write to you , and the week has been rather eventful .
I plan to go to live in the house tomorrow , but having already bought things , and having more to add — and I’m talking only of what’s strictly necessary — you’ll have to send me 100 francs again , instead of 50 .
If I count 50 francs for myself for last week , and if I therefore deduct them from the 300 francs sent , I only have left , even with another 50 francs extra , the bare price of the two beds . And so you see that , even if I’ve already bought many other things in addition to the beds themselves , with bed linen , that I’ve spent most of the 50 francs for the week on it , and in part I’ve saved on one bed or the other by making one of them a little plainer . I’m convinced that in the end we’re doing well by furnishing the studio .
And as for work , I already feel freer and less harrowed by unnecessary worries than before .
 
Only if I take greater care , I hope , over the style and quality of my work , it will go a little more slowly , or rather , I’ll be obliged to keep the paintings with me longer . So that there’ll be things that hold together and complement each other . And also because there’ll be paintings that I really don’t want to send you before they’re as dry as a bone .
In this last category is a no . 30 square canvas of a corner of a garden with a weeping tree , grass , round-trimmed cedar bushes , an oleander bush . Therefore the same corner of a garden of which you already have a study in the last consignment .
But as it’s larger , there’s a lemon-coloured sky above it all , and then the colours have the richness and intensities of autumn . Then it’s done in much heavier impasto , plain and thick .
That’s the first painting this week . The second shows the outside of a
  café , lit on the terrace outside by a large gas-lamp in the blue night , with a patch of starry blue sky .
The third painting this week is a portrait of myself , almost colourless , in ashy tones against a pale Veronese background .
I purposely bought a good enough mirror to work from myself , for want of a model , because if I can manage to paint the coloration of my own head , which is not without presenting some difficulty , I’ll surely be able to paint the heads of the other fellows and women as well .
The question of painting night scenes or effects , on the spot and actually at night , interests me enormously . This week I’ve done absolutely nothing but paint and sleep and take my meals . That means sessions of twelve hours , 6 hours , depending , and then 12-hour periods of sleep , also at a single stretch .
 
I read in the literary supplement of Saturday’s Figaro (15 Sept . ) the description of an Impressionist house . This house was built , as would be the bottoms of bottles , of bricks of rounded glass — purple glass . With the sun glancing off it , the yellow glints flashing from it , it produced an extraordinary effect .
To support these walls of glass bricks in the shape of purple eggs , they had devised a support in black and gilded iron , representing strange shoots of vines and other climbing plants . This purple house was right in the middle of a garden , all of whose paths were made of a very yellow sand . The beds of ornamental flowers were naturally most extraordinary in their coloration . This house , if I remember well , must be in Auteuil . Without changing anything at the house , either now or later , I’d nevertheless like to make it , through the decoration , an artist’s house . That will come . I shake your hand firmly . I took a magnificent walk by myself in the vineyards today .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
