Letter|My dear Theo ,
I received your letter , and I thank you for it and for the enclosure .
When you write that you’re again facing your bad half year — for it lasts a 1/2 year , I think — it isn’t exactly pleasant news for you to write nor for me to receive .
However , we must try to do something about it to ensure that things go better for both of us .
Before I received your letter and enclosure , I had already done something that you probably won’t approve of , but about which I don’t really value your opinion much , I’m sorry to have to say . I have again set in train an attempt to get back on good terms with Mauve , with Tersteeg too , if possible . I don’t know whether it will succeed — however , I must have more scope , for with the best will in the world , if one has been , as I have now , A WHOLE YEAR AND MORE entirely outside the world of painting , one works oneself into the ground outside and has to refresh oneself .
You never feel or understand that and say ‘just keep on painting’ , and that’s all you can say . I don’t blame you for it , but I don’t find it intelligent of you either — be aware of that .
 
What you say is perfectly true: that if I make good paintings I’m more likely to achieve something than by discussing revolutionary questions . (*) I actually find this so true that while you were writing it I was just taking a step directly aimed at the progress of my work , by asking once more to paint a few studies in Mauve’s studio .
You always contradict yourself — the above-mentioned passage (*) in your letter is immediately followed by the question as to whether I could perhaps give you some new principles about the issue of reforming the trade .
I’d like to recommend one to you in your and in my personal interests (never mind about the general interest): back my approach to Mauve and to Tersteeg .
 
Help me to get going and earn money , not only by sending money but also through your influence and more cooperation and a better sort of friendship . I say again , back the approach I’ve made , for instance , for it should have been made sooner with support on your part .
Do it generously and resolutely , not hesitating or being non-committal when it comes to the point .
There’s enough strength in me to be able to do something and to earn too . And then — as you say yourself — if I make progress with my paintings and capture a good , independent position , I’ll be worth more than now .
  Then — later in other words — when I’m doing a bit better — I’ll be very happy to try to give you new principles about the issues of reforming the trade — concerning which I certainly do have my ideas , which derive from my own experience of what hinders painters’ progress , and what sort of things sometimes make the painter’s life unbearable .
Now isn’t the moment to write to you about it at length . I only say this — if you or if I need money to make progress and if we can only work at half speed at the moment for financial reasons , we’ll have to see to it that we get it , and struggle on until we do get it — Not argue that ‘we’re facing a half year that’s going to be bad financially , so reconcile yourself to it’ . What has to be found , can be .
I’ve written to Mauve and to T . If you want to support me , so much the better .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
Don’t misunderstand me , though — I haven’t written to M . or to Tersteeg in a complaining tone . On the contrary , but I have said as forcefully as I could: give me another opportunity to make some studies with Mauve .
That’s what I asked — nothing else , and that’s all I need .
They mustn’t be involved in the financial side at all . If I can’t save up for it myself , you’ll have to make the utmost effort to send me an extra 100 francs , because I won’t be going for long —
or if you absolutely can’t , Pa will have to try to advance it . I’ll hammer away at it until M . agrees .
  If I don’t succeed on my own , we must both ask Mauve until he does it .
Then — after that — I’ll again have a few tips for improving my work here and making progress with it .
And again have a pied-à-terre with a good , sound painter . And then I guarantee that something will soon happen — either I’ll exhibit or I’ll sell .
When I wrote to you , ACT , it isn’t just a WORD , Theo — you hear! But it’s to say to you , are we going onward together or would you rather stay behind?
I’d rather we went onward together , but there mustn’t be any nagging .
  If the financial aspect was a problem both for you and for Pa , then I could get it from Rappard .
And so , courage! But let’s go onward together and hammer away at it together until we’ve achieved it .
If you don’t want to join me , then I’ll carry on alone . Do give me an answer to this . Of course , I may hear nothing from M . or T .
If I hear anything , I’ll write to you immediately . And if it takes too long , it will have to be repeated , either by me alone or by both of us , just as you wish . Rappard is doing very well and several others too , but they really haven’t had only patience and resignation . We must go onward .
 
Get used to the idea that we must move .
It’s not for nothing that I’ve been slogging away at the principles of drawing as well as of colour and painting technique since I was first with M .
I’ve learned some new things , but I need Mauve again , or someone else who’s very clever — not to make me swollen-headed — but to give me some courage , which fails me if things drag on too long .
Onward — and it doesn’t matter a damn if it fails — if it fails , then do it again .
  It’s essential to carry on forcefully — with renewed energy — and then the business between you and me can work out to our mutual satisfaction , and instead of rebukes and nasty remarks , something spirited and good can come of it .
It’s very true that I’ve spent more this year than last on firstly my work , secondly myself . I’m not sorry for it , though — I’ve progressed in precisely what will rectify things in painting later and — the only thing I do regret is that I haven’t been able to spend a few hundred guilders more . What I’ve gained by it , for instance , is that I can now easily paint a head from the model in a morning , and that at last my colour is becoming sounder and more accurate , and more character is appearing in the technique . Now I can well understand that what I say — I needed and still need money for this — will be criticized . But one can’t ignore the fact that one needs working capital for the profession of painter just as much as for simply the shoemaker’s trade , for instance .
 
Working capital that could generate very good interest after a few years , then anyway , 20% to start with , for example .
And could be paid back later .
So that the money from you , say we call it 5 , 000 francs at a pinch , is my working capital .
The interest on this — if we could get it to 20% through the energy of both of us — would be proof of the rightness of your insights and also of mine , and of a sound view of business .
Now that result — 20% interest a year on 5 , 000 francs — I’d like you to help me get it .
These are facts and figures , and you must see to it that you get your confidence and energy back in this matter .
I’ll have to work hard to achieve this result — but — as I see it — for your part you can just do something you said you’d do before — take my side — not neutrally but energetically , positively .
 
I tell you once more from total conviction , from the BUSINESS point of view — as a dealer , if you will , that the system of only doing business when one is sure of succeeding is not the best , and actually one of looking at things from a mediocre point of view .
Doing business , doing something come what may and moving for the sake of moving , hating stagnation and sterility , is to my mind a more open-hearted and also more profitable way . So the eternal — not being non-committal — not worrying about things too much — having a certain self-confidence — these things , I already spoke about them in the past ; and what a few later years showed me , was truly to become more convinced that carrying on a fight and concentrating on a few points , but at the same time risking everything , is the best thing .
But the cooler characters — the Bourdoncles — doubt this . However , I’m quite prepared to appreciate them , too , and they undoubtedly have their qualities — but to push something through , to persevere , to win . . . when it comes to the point , they lapse into vacillation and hesitancy .
 
And then , naturally , business marks time and comes to a standstill .
Anyway .
Now look here — to make progress , because I’m just getting into my stride , I have to paint 50 heads . As soon as possible and one after the other . I have calculated , but it won’t be possible to work with the energy that I want to devote to it in terms of exertion and effort without extra . I needed an overcoat — because I’m taking more trouble over my clothes than before — and other things , including the paint bills , take a lot of what I get . So that in order to carry out my plan quickly , working at full speed (instead of half speed for the sake of economy — and yet , that can actually save nothing) , I must manage to get an extra 100 francs . In order to win over Tersteeg and Mauve , I must do something decidedly energetic now , having broached the matter . Is it absolutely impossible for you to let me have it now? I must strike the iron now , it’s hot , but — my dear brother and friend — STOKE UP THE FIRE . Adieu .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
