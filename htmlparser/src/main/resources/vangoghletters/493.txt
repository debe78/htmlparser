Letter|My dear Theo ,
Many thanks for your registered letter of yesterday and the enclosure . Pursuant to that , I’m writing again right away and enclose herewith a scratch , more precise than the one before , after my latest study .
I haven’t been able to work it up as far as had been my intention . I painted 3 days continuously from early till late , and by Saturday evening the paint started to get into a state that didn’t allow further work . Unless it’s completely dry first .
I’ve been to Eindhoven today to order a small stone , since this is to be the first in a series of lithographs , which I’m planning to start again . When you were here , I asked you about the cost of reproduction by the G&amp ; Cie process . You said then , I believe , 100 francs .
Well — the old — ordinary lithographic process , thought so poorly of nowadays , is nevertheless a good deal cheaper — particularly in Eindhoven perhaps .
I’m now getting use of the stone — graining , paper and printing of 50 copies for 3 guilders . I’m thinking of making a series of subjects from peasant life , in short — the peasants at home .
Today I went for a splendid walk for hours with an of mine , whose first watercolour of a figure I showed you .
I don’t say that there isn’t even more stirring and more dramatic nature in Brittany , say , in Katwijk , say , in the Borinage , say — yes — but even so — the heaths and the villages here are still very beautiful , and just being here I see in it an inexhaustible resource for subjects from peasant life — and the question is just — to seize it — to work . I have a great desire to start making watercolours and drawings again , too — and when I’m living in my studio I’ll make time for it in the evenings .
 
I was really immensely pleased that you sent that 100 francs . As I said , it was absolutely essential that I paid a few things — and that was preoccupying me . It’s not that people were pestering me , though , but because I knew that they were in need of it . And that’s why I wrote that I could be obliged to reserve a small part when the affairs were to be settled .
But that’s not necessary , now — although I can tell you I know for sure the year will be very grim .
But I just think about what Millet said: ‘I would never do away with suffering , for it is often that which makes artists express themselves most vigorously’ .
I’m thinking of moving about 1 May — although , of course , things are all right with Ma and the — nevertheless I see and feel it’s so much for the better — for living together would become insupportable in the long run . Which I don’t so much ascribe to them personally nor to me personally either , but rather to the irreconcilability of the ideas of people who keep up a position and — a peasant painter — who doesn’t think about it .
When I say that I’m a peasant painter , that is really so , and will become clearer to you in future ; I feel at home there . And it’s not for nothing that I’ve spent so many evenings sitting pondering by the fire with the miners and the peat-cutters and the weavers and peasants here — unless I had no time to think — because of the work . I’ve become so absorbed in peasant life by continually seeing it at all hours of the day that I really hardly ever think of anything else .
 
You write that the public mood — that is , indifference — to Millet’s work — as you just had the opportunity to see at that exhibition — isn’t encouraging , either for the artists or for those who have to sell paintings . I agree — but Millet himself felt and knew that — and , on reading Sensier , what he said about the start of his career struck me so much that although I don’t remember it literally , I remember the sense of it , that is , ‘that (i . e . that indifference) would be bad enough for me if I needed fine shoes and the life of a gentleman — but — because I go around in clogs , I shall manage’ . And that’s how it turned out .
So what I hope not to forget is that — ‘it’s a question of going around in clogs’ , that is of being content as regards food , drink , clothes , sleep , with what the peasants are content with .
That’s what Millet did — and — didn’t want anything else anyway — and in my view this means that as a human being he has shown painters a way that Israëls and Mauve , say , who live quite luxuriously , do not show , and I say again — Millet is — PÈRE Millet , that is , counsellor and guide in everything , for the younger painters . Most of them I know , though (but I don’t know all that many) would decline this . As to me — I think the same , and entirely believe what he says . I’m speaking about what Millet says at some length , precisely because you write about the question that when city-dwellers paint peasants , their figures , splendidly painted though they may be , nonetheless can’t help reminding one of the Parisian suburbs .
 
I’ve also had that impression sometimes (although , to my mind , the woman digging potatoes by B . Lepage is certainly an exception) , but isn’t it precisely because the painters are so often not deeply enough involved personally in peasant life? Millet said on another occasion — in art one must give heart and soul .
Degroux — this is one of his qualities — painted real peasants . (And they — the State — demanded history pieces of him! — which he also did well , but how much better he was when he could be himself . )
It’s an abiding shame and loss for the Belgians that Degroux still isn’t appreciated as fully as he deserves — Degroux is one of the good Millet masters . But even if the general public didn’t and don’t acknowledge him — and although he remains in obscurity , like Daumier , like Tassaert — there are still people , Mellery , for example , to mention just one , who are again making work today that has his sentiment .
I recently saw something by Mellery in an illustrated magazine ; a bargee’s family in the little deckhouse on their barge — husband , wife , children — round a table . As far as general sympathy is concerned — years ago I read something about it in Renan that has always stayed with me and that I’ll always go on believing — that anyone who really wants to accomplish something good or useful should neither count on nor wish for general approbation or appreciation , but on the contrary should expect nothing other than that only a very few hearts — and even then only maybe — will sympathize and join in .
If you run into someone from Le Chat Noir , you can show them this little scratch for now , but I can make a better one if they like , because this is very much in haste and serves only to give you a clearer idea of effect and composition than the first . Regards and thanks , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
You needn’t tell Le Chat Noir that I’m also planning to make a lithograph of this thing myself . That lithograph won’t be published anyway , but is entirely private . By the way , I don’t really mind if they don’t want it — because I’ll certainly lithograph myself what I want to lithograph .
