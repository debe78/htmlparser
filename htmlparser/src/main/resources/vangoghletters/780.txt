Letter|My dear ,
If I didn’t write to you quickly this Sunday morning while the canvases I’ve begun are drying a little in the sun , I would wait even longer to answer your kind letter .
I hope that you’re well , and Mother too , I think of you two very often , I was scarcely able to foresee , when I went from Nuenen to Antwerp , that the course of events would keep me away for so long and at such a distance . That’s perhaps why my thoughts often still stray involuntarily to those parts , and it seems to me then that I’m continuing the same work left unfinished there , when so many things in nature remain parallel . Although I feel with an obstinate ingratitude that my health is returning little by little , the fact is that I am well ; but as I tell you , the desire to begin again , the joy of living , is hardly great .
I’ve just finished a landscape of an olive grove with grey foliage more or less like that of the willows , their cast shadows violet on the sun-drenched sand . Then yet another that depicts a field of yellowing wheat surrounded by brambles and green bushes . At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that stands out against the distant purplish and bluish hills , and against a forget-me-not blue sky streaked with pink
  whose pure tones contrast with the already heavy , scorched ears , whose tones are as warm as the crust of a loaf of bread .
I have yet another in which a field of wheat on the slope of the hills is completely ravaged and knocked to the ground by a downpour , and which is drenched by the torrential shower .
It seems to me that the people here work a lot less than the peasants in our country , one scarcely sees any cattle , and the countryside almost always has more of a deserted look than it does at home . This seems most deplorable to me , all the more so since nature isn’t ungenerous and the air is so pure and so healthy . So one would wish to see a more energetic race of people here . The cases aren’t perhaps rare here where doing nothing becomes doing bad . In the north , aren’t there heaps of honest workmen without enough bread because there one works so much that work is no longer valued? I don’t say that this is always the case , but anyway there’s something of that kind however . Ah well , the farms here could produce three times what they do if they were well-kept , and the whole land if it was manured . By producing three times as much , the land here could thus feed a lot more people .
Now I think you asked me if , still supposing that love is a bacillus (which I myself am not in a position to state or prove , please don’t lose sight of that) , I think that you asked me
  if there are people who would have the said bacillus and others who wouldn’t have it , or if on the contrary it was a fatal and universal illness . On that point , too , I’m rather unqualified to form a clearly well-founded opinion . But I consider it probable that if a person , yourself say , is convinced she didn’t have it , it would perhaps be wise for such a person to have herself inoculated with the said bacillus according to the Pasteur or some other method . Joking apart , I believe that a man or woman inevitably has to be in love with something , and that the only precaution one can take would be to fall in love in such and such a way and not in another one , according to one’s ideas .
And to know what one wants in such matters – alas we know ourselves so little .
Besides , I’d almost think that women take the offensive in these matters ; that the wise ones among them , or rather those who have the most correct and sure instinct , don’t wait to be loved in order to love themselves – which – and I’m inclined to believe for good reasons – would appear to be the essential thing to them .
Anyway , it could very well be that by being inoculated with the attenuated bacillus , of the well-chosen virus and in the correct dose , one would be better protected from contagion . If one doesn’t yet have the illness one doesn’t prevent oneself perhaps getting it , while when one has it one can no longer catch it .
I’m quite curious to have some news of Theo , who appears pretty absorbed in his honeymoon , which is very good . He sent me some colours and canvas last week , but it will soon be a month since I had news of him by letter .
 
It’s a great consolation for me to know that he no longer lives alone . His wrote me a very nice letter a while ago , which proved to me that she’s really serious . She’ll certainly still need this , and for a long time to come , for Theo’s life is quite complicated because of his duty towards Boussod &amp ; Co . And as for her , she’ll learn more to live with him than without him , without being obliged to change too much and forget what she already knows of Dutch things .
I’m going off to work a little more , so as I finish I wish you and Mother all good fortune and health . I kiss you affectionately in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
