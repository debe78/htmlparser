Paris , 19 June 1875
My dear Theo ,
I had hoped to see her again before she died , and that didn’t happen . Man proposes and God disposes .
In the first crate we send to Holland you’ll find a photo of that painting by P . de Champaigne , of which Michelet , ‘she stayed with me for 30 years , coming back to me incessantly’ , also an etching by Daubigny after Ruisdael’s ‘Bush’ , a lithograph after Corot’s ‘Sunset’ , a lithograph by Bodmer , ‘Fontainebleau in the autumn’ and two Jacque etchings .
Adieu
Vincent
I don’t know how long I’ll be staying here , but before I return to London I hope to go to Helvoirt . I hope you’ll be there too . I’ll pay for the journey .
 
You certainly won’t forget her and her death , but keep it to yourself . This is one of those things that , little by little , makes us ‘sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing’ ; and that we must become .
