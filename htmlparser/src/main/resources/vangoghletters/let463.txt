Letter|My dear Theo ,
I send you herewith two photographs — you’ll get another two of weavers later .
I was planning to have 12 photographs taken , a series of Brabant scenes , including the 6 that I’m making for Hermans .
I was planning to send them to a few illustrated magazines to see if I could get work , or at least become known .
But I’ve decided against it , since the photographer only produces prints that reflect none , or at least far too little of the original chiaroscuro , moreover retouches a great deal and badly , and even so still often leaves things dark that are light in the painting and vice versa .
I’ll have another proof made of the weavers , though , just as cartes de visite . Because I’m so far away from the illustrated magazines here I must find some means of establishing a few connections in ways other than by word of mouth .
 
I hope to make various drawings this winter , of those very same aforesaid compositions , and try sending them to the London News , say — which as you may have noticed is now often better than the Graphic and , among other things , just published a very fine Frank Holl and a fine landscape with sheep .
I’ve worked really hard recently ; I believe , in conjunction with other agitation , even overworked . At least I’m in a sad mood , and all these things have affected me to such an extent that I have many days when I’m relatively powerless . I can’t eat and I can’t sleep , that’s to say not enough , and that makes one weak .
But I’ll get over it , particularly because I have fairly good tidings from Utrecht . But I’m still very concerned because I fear it will be a long time before recovers completely .
  Perhaps it will also take me a long time before I get over it .
I still deeply regret , Theo , that I’m on one side , you on the other , of a certain barricade that may no longer be visible in the form of paving-stones , but which still definitely exists and persists in society .
In that lithograph by Daumier or De Lemud , whichever of them it may be , the main subject is precisely a person whose story I remember . There were two brothers and they were on the same side and both fell , one a day after the other , for the same cause . That might have been so in our case , but now it’s as good as certain that it will never happen . For my part I’m well aware that , come what may , the future will always be very difficult for me , and I know as good as for certain that things won’t go what people describe as well for me in the future .
 
I believe that Pa also feels something of the fact that it’s more fate than deliberate design when there’s sometimes such a decided difference of opinion . But I wish to hit no one ; wish that Pa hadn’t sometimes gone and stood right in front of me .
Anyway , I sometimes think now and again that painting can in any event forestall many disasters , and that otherwise it would be even worse . I presently have no other plans for the future except to continue with my Brabant subjects until I’ve got them so far that I could dispose of them in Belgium , say , and sell a few drawings elsewhere . Then , when I feel on rather firmer ground , I’d like to go back to the miners again . I’d be forever gratified if you were gradually to arrange it in such a way that we can’t hit each other , even though the gun barrels are pointing in opposite directions . I don’t ask of you that you sympathize with my work , for instance , but if you ever hear of a resource , tell me . Rappard has been in Drenthe and on Terschelling again , and appears to have netted a goodly catch of studies . He’s probably coming here again for a while in October .
Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
The painting of the sower is the same size as the woman spinning ; the colour of the soil is neutral but slightly pink , light green further away .
The man’s smock is blue and the trousers brown . The gaiters dirty linen . I fancy that the head shows up against the sky better in the painting than in the photograph .
Listen , Theo — about the barricade — you know there’s been a time in my life when I was also in the Guizot people’s camp — I’ve also believed all sorts of fine and good things about Pa and Haanebeek , about Grandfather , about ‘the Guizots’ in short .
But when I regretted it , you know that I also turned around with energy and tenacity .
The newer men of today don’t want me , though — that’s all right , I DON’T CARE ABOUT THAT — both as people and as painters , I prefer the generation of around 48 to around 84 , but as to 48 , not the Guizot but the revolutionaries , Michelet — and also the peasant painters of Barbizon .
