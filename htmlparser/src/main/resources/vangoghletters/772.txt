Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter . You’re quite right to say that Mr Salles has been perfect in all of this , I’m much obliged to him .
I wanted to tell you that I think I’ve done well to come here , first , in seeing the reality of the life of the diverse mad or cracked people in this menagerie , I’m losing the vague dread , the fear of the thing . And little by little I can come to consider madness as being an illness like any other . Then the change of surroundings is doing me good , I imagine .
As far as I know the doctor here is inclined to consider what I’ve had as an attack of an epileptic nature . But I haven’t made any enquiries .
Have you by chance yet received the crate of paintings , I’m curious to know if they’ve suffered more , yes or no .
I have two others on the go — violet irises and a lilac bush . Two subjects taken from the garden .
The idea of my duty to work comes back to me a lot , and I believe that all my faculties for work will come back to me quite quickly . It’s just that work often absorbs me so much that I think I’ll always be absent-minded and awkward in getting by for the rest of life too .
I won’t write you a long letter — I’ll try to answer the letter from my new , which greatly touched me , but I don’t know if I’ll manage to do it .
Handshake , and ever yours ,
Vincent
 
My dear ,
Thanks very much for your letter , in which I above all looked for news of my brother . And I find it very good . I can see that you have already observed that he loves Paris and that this surprises you a little , you who don’t like it , or rather who above all like the flowers there , such as , I suppose , for example , the wisterias which are probably beginning to flower . Could it not be the case that in liking a thing one sees it better and more accurately than in not liking it .
For him and for me Paris is certainly already a cemetery in a way , where many artists have perished , whom we knew directly or indirectly .
Certainly Millet , whom you’ll learn to like a lot , and with him many others , have tried to get out of Paris . But Eugène Delacroix , for example , it’s difficult to portray him ‘as a man’ other than as a Parisian .
All this to urge you — with all caution , admittedly — to believe in the possibility that there are homes in Paris , and not just apartments .
 
Anyway — fortunately you are now his home yourself .
It’s quite odd perhaps that the result of this terrible attack is that in my mind there’s hardly any really clear desire or hope left , and I’m wondering if it is thus that one thinks when , with the passions somewhat extinguished , one comes down the mountain instead of climbing it . Anyway my sister , if you can believe , or almost , that everything is always for the best in the best of worlds then you’ll also be able to believe , perhaps , that Paris is the best of the towns in it .
Have you noticed yet that the old cab-horses there have big , beautiful heartbroken eyes , like Christians sometimes . Whatever the case , we’re not savages nor peasants , and we perhaps even have a duty to love civilization (so-called) . Anyway , it would probably be hypocritical to say or believe that Paris is bad when one lives there . The first time one sees Paris it may be , besides , that everything there seems against nature , dirty and sad . Anyway , if you don’t like Paris , above all do not like painting nor those who directly or indirectly are engaged in it , for it’s only too doubtful whether that’s beautiful or useful .
But what can you do , there are people who love nature while being cracked or ill , those are the painters , then there are some who love what is done by the hand of man , and those even go as far as liking paintings .
 
Although there are a few people here who are seriously ill , the fear , the horror that I had of madness before has already been greatly softened .
And although one continually hears shouts and terrible howls as though of the animals in a menagerie , despite this the people here know each other very well , and help each other when they suffer crises . They all come to see when I’m working in the garden , and I can assure you are more discreet and more polite to leave me in peace than , for example , the good citizens of Arles .
It’s possible that I’ll stay here for quite a long time , never have I been so tranquil as here and at the hospital in Arles to be able to paint a little at last . Very near here there are some little grey or blue mountains , with very , very green wheatfields at their foot , and pines .
I shall count myself very happy if I manage to work enough to earn my living , for it makes me very worried when I tell myself that I’ve done so many paintings and drawings without ever selling any . Don’t be in too much of a hurry to consider this an injustice , I don’t know anything at all about it .
Thanking you again for writing to me , and being very happy to know that now my brother doesn’t return to an empty apartment when he comes home in the evening , I shake your hand in thought , and believe me
your brother
Vincent
