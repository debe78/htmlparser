Paris , 28 March 1876
My dear Theo ,
A few more words , probably the last I’ll write to you from Paris .
I’ll probably leave here on Friday evening to be home on Saturday morning at the same time as at Christmas .
Yesterday I saw around 6 paintings by Michel , how I wish you’d been there , sunken roads through sandy soil leading to a mill , or a man going home over the heath or sandy ground with a grey sky above , so simple and so fine . It seems to me that the pilgrims on their way to Emmaus saw nature as Michel does , I always think of them whenever I see one of his paintings .
At the same time I saw a painting by Jules Dupré ,
  and a very large one at that .
As far as the eye could see , black marshy terrain , in the middle distance a river and in the foreground a pond (near it 3 horses) . Reflected in both , the bank of white and grey clouds behind which the sun has set ; on the horizon some greyish red and purple , the upper sky a gentle blue .
I saw these paintings at Durand-Ruel’s . There they have no fewer than 25 etchings after Millet , and the same number after Michel , and masses after Dupré and Corot and all other artists , to be had for 1 franc apiece . That’s tempting indeed . I couldn’t resist buying a couple after Millet: I bought the last 3 of The evening angelus , and my brother will of course receive one when the opportunity arises .
I hear that Mr Iterson is coming to live at Rooses’ , he’s the youngest , I believe . Write again soon . Regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and to anyone who might ask after me , and in thought a handshake , and ever
Your loving brother
Vincent .
Adieu!
