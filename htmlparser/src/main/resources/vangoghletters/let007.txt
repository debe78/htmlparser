The Hague , 5 May 1873
My dear Theo ,
You mustn’t take it amiss , old chap , that I didn’t remember your birthday . Many congratulations ; I hope that things will continue to go well for you this year , and that you’ll take more and more pleasure in your work .
 
My time is drawing to a close . On Saturday I’ll go home and take my leave , and then on Sunday on to Paris . I’m afraid it’ll end up being Monday , however , and that on Sunday I’ll still be in Helvoirt . I hope I’ll be able to write to you in time about when I’ll be passing through Brussels , but it’s quite possible that I won’t be able to , as I don’t yet know for sure when I have to be in Paris at the latest .
 
How are Uncle and Aunt? Have they moved yet? Be sure to write to me soon about that , I’ll give you my address below . I’m writing in haste , as you can imagine I’m busy . Adieu , I wish you well . Give my warm regards to Uncle and Aunt , also to Mr Schmidt and Eduard . Ever your loving brother
Vincent .
