Letter|Cuesmes , 20 August 1880
Dear Theo ,
If I’m not mistaken , you should still have Millet’s ‘The labours of the fields’ . Would you be so kind as to lend them to me for a short while , and to send them to me by post?
You should know that I’m sketching large drawings after Millet , and that I’ve done The four times of the day , as well as The sower .
Well , if you saw them perhaps you wouldn’t be too unhappy with them . Now , if you’d like to send me The labours of the fields , perhaps you could also add some other sheets by or after Millet , J . Breton , Feyen-Perrin , &amp ; c . Don’t buy any specially , but lend me what you may have .
Send me what you can , and don’t have any fears on my account . If only I can go on working , I’ll recover somehow . But you’d be a great help to me by doing this . If you pay a visit to Holland sooner or later , I hope you won’t pass by without coming to see the scratches .
I’m writing to you while drawing and I’m in a hurry to get back to it , so good-night , and send the sheets as soon as possible , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent

Cuesmes .
The Millet that I’ve done are The four times of the day , the format more or less that of a sheet from the Bargue drawing course .
 
You’ll understand well enough yourself what I need to make it unnecessary for me to tell you , but I’ll tell you nevertheless , so that you can know my thinking .
They’re mainly figure studies , such as Millet’s The diggers , or the lithograph after his Winnower . And figures by Brion or Frère or Feyen-Perrin or Jules Breton .
I believe you could find just what I need at the Alliance des Arts , where they have the lithographs by Contemporary Artists &amp ; c . , which are sold there extremely cheaply . A sheet that I’d be immensely glad to have is Daubigny’s large etching after Ruisdael , The bush , which is on sale at the print-shop in the Louvre .
I’ve done a scratch of miners , male and female thrutchers , going to the pit in the morning , in the snow , on a path beside a thorn-hedge: passing shadows , dimly visible in the dusk . In the background , the large mine buildings and the slag heap are becoming indistinct against the sky . I’m sending you the croquis so that you can picture it for yourself . But I feel the need to study figure drawing from masters like Millet , Breton and Brion or Boughton , or someone else . What do you think of the croquis? Does the idea seem good to you?
In the photographs after J . Breton by Bingham there is , if I remember rightly , one of women gleaners . Dark silhouettes against a sky in which the sun is setting , red . There you are , it’s things like that I need to have before my eyes . It’s because I think you’d prefer to see me doing something good than doing nothing at all that I’m writing to you on this subject , and perhaps it would be a reason why good understanding and friendship might be re-established between the two of us , and we might perhaps be useful to one another .
I’d very much like to execute the drawing in question better than I have done . In the one that I’ve done , as it stands , the figures might be about 10 centimetres high . The pendant is of the miners’ return , but it’s less successful as it stands . It’s very difficult , as it involves an effect of brown silhouettes encircled by light against a streaky sunset sky .
Send The labours of the fields by return of post if you can and if you will .

I’ve dropped a line to Mr Tersteeg to ask him if perhaps there would be some way for me to have Bargue’s Exercices au fusain for a while , i . e . the studies of the nude model you’re familiar with . I don’t know if he’ll do it or not , that’s to say send me them , but supposing he didn’t , couldn’t you influence him a little in my favour? Because these Exercices au fusain would be eminently useful to me . But perhaps he’ll do me the favour of sending me at least some sheets , if not the whole course .
