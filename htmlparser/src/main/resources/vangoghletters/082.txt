Letter|Ramsgate , 12 May 1876
My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter ; I also like ‘Tell me the old , old story’ very much . I first heard it sung in Paris , in the evening in a small church I used to attend sometimes . No . 12 is also beautiful . I regret not having gone to hear Moody and Sankey when they were in London . There’s such a yearning for Religion among the people in those big cities . Many a worker in a factory or shop has had a remarkable , pure , pious youth . But city life often takes away ‘the early dew of morning’ , yet the yearning for ‘the old , old story’ remains , the bottom of one’s heart remains the bottom of one’s heart . In one of his books , Eliot describes the
  life of factory workers &amp ; c . who have joined a small community and hold religious services in a chapel in ‘Lantern Yard’ , and he says it is ‘God’s Kingdom upon earth’ , nothing more nor less .
And there’s something moving about seeing the thousands now flocking to hear those evangelists .
I think your plan to give Pa and Ma ‘After the departure’ by Sadée is very good ; that’s agreed , then .
Willemien may be already there on 21 May . I see from your letter that you’re also thinking of going . Do it , old boy , if you can manage it . Sometimes such actions receive a special blessing . How it would surprise them .
There was something wistful in Ma’s last letter , in which she wrote a word or two about the necessity of our being so far from home .
  And Ma’s eyes are hurting her again .
Come on , old boy , brighten them up again by being there on that day .
This afternoon Mr Reid sent me the catalogue of the exhibition in London .
In thought a handshake , and congratulations on the birthdays of Lies and Cor , and also on 21 May . Regards to everyone at Rooses’ . In haste .
Your loving brother .
Vincent .
