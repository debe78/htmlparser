Letter|Tuesday morning .
My dear Theo ,
This time I have something to tell you about a visit from Mr Tersteeg . He came here this morning — and saw Sien and the . I would have wished that he could at least have put on a friendly face for a young mother who gave birth a fortnight ago , but apparently that was asking too much . My dear Theo , he spoke to me in a way you can perhaps understand:
What was the meaning of this and that child? Where on earth did I get the idea of living with a woman , and with as well?
Wasn’t it as ridiculous as if I were to drive about the city in my own carriage? To which I replied that it was most definitely a different matter entirely .
Was I not right in the head? It was obviously the product of a sick mind and body .
I told him that I’d just received ample reassurances from people much better qualified than he , namely the doctors at the hospital , as regards both my body and my mental strength being capable of making a sustained effort .
 
He kept chopping and changing from one subject to another , dragging in my Father and , just imagine , my in Princenhage!!! Would get involved . Would write .
My dear Theo , for the ’s sake , for my own sake , I restrained myself , I didn’t get angry . I gave curt and plain answers to his in my view all too indiscreet questions , perhaps too gently , but I preferred to resort to too gently rather than perhaps getting angry . He gradually calmed down a little . I asked him if it wouldn’t seem rather ridiculous if at home they received an outraged letter from him followed by a friendly invitation from me to come here at my expense to discuss the very same matter . This had some effect in that he looked surprised . Was I going to write? Do you question that? , I said , of course – but now you must admit that this is hardly a suitable moment , just when they’re in the middle of moving at home and the woman is in such a state that the least emotion could cause a prolapse of the womb that might never be put right . Making her feel fearful , anxious and nervous now is murder .
  Oh in that case , of course , he wouldn’t write , and then again saying that I was as foolish as someone who wanted to jump into the water and he was trying to hold me back . I said that I didn’t doubt his good intentions , and that for that reason I tried not to be angered by his words , even though I found such a conversation most disagreeable .
And finally , because I clearly showed that I wanted to end the conversation , he left .
I’m writing to you immediately . I told him that I wrote to you about it , no more than that . This also calmed him somewhat .
You know that I don’t want to hide it , but for Sien , for the , and for me too , it would be better if there were no more scenes like this . Causing the woman to become agitated is to give her a hard blow . I can’t say this often enough . She is well , but weak and highly sensitive . The slightest thing can spoil her milk and lead to far worse , at least in the first six weeks .
I tried to turn the conversation to the drawings , but he just looked around quickly – Oh , those are the old ones . There were some new ones but he didn’t seem to see them . As you know , most of the recent ones are either with you , or C . M . still has them &amp ; c . He was overhasty in everything .
Only one thing is clear: I am as mad and wrong as can be . I ask you , how is it possible to speak to someone like that , and what good can it do?
 
This is exactly what I fear: an unsympathetic , schoolmasterly , unfeeling and indiscreet meddling in my most intimate and private affairs . No one could remain calm in the face of that . So although I didn’t get angry , I do severely blame Mr Tersteeg , and I don’t want to have anything to do with him or speak to him as long as he’s in this police officer mood . I’m writing to you about it immediately . I believe he’s capable of causing all sorts of misery with his untimely meddling at home and by sowing unrest in Princenhage (and Princenhage has nothing , absolutely nothing to do with it) , and upsetting everyone . Can’t this be stopped???
Things are all right with home at the moment , but , you’ll see , who knows whether he won’t ruin it all again .
I intend writing myself as soon as possible , but it’s so rotten of Tersteeg to be such a troublemaker . And to whom? — a poor , weak who gave birth a fortnight ago .
No , it’s an ugly business , but he doesn’t feel that . With him it’s always and forever the same old thing , money . He has no other God , it seems . For my part I feel that one should be kind and gentle to women , children and the weak , and I have a sort of respect and emotion for them .
 
He had another gibe — I would make the woman unhappy , &amp ; c . I said that he wasn’t in a position to judge that now , and I asked him not to say such a thing again . Sien loves me and I love Sien . We want to and can live together , the two of us , on what I would otherwise have on my own — we can scrimp and scrape in every way and as much as possible . You know well enough how I’ve talked about this before .
I can’t repeat too often , brother , how my whole future depends on this . A person can get over it once if he is crippled and wounded in love and in his affairs and plans . But that mustn’t happen too often . And now I have recovered or am in the process of recovering in body and soul , and Sien too , but it could be fatal if we were again hammered into the ground , so to speak . So give this some thought and , if you’re able to do anything , try to prevent Tersteeg or others from working against me too much . I can’t yet defend myself as I could if I were back to normal . I must become immersed in my work again , carefully , very carefully , but I
  really can’t yet bear visits like the one this morning .
You at least know more about the matter than Tersteeg , but you still know Sien too little to know how much we love each other and how well we get on together .
If Tersteeg had his way , and others too , they’d of course tear Sien and me apart .
That’s what he’s after , and they wouldn’t shrink from using force .
It depends on whether we have the monthly sum from you to allow us to stay together .
For my part , I shall refuse the monthly sum from you as soon as you adopt the same point of view as Tersteeg . I don’t want to leave Sien in the lurch . If I don’t have her I’ll be broken , and then I would also be broken in my work and everything else . Then I would never get over that and , not wishing to be a burden or expense to you any longer , would only say to you: Theo , I’m a broken man and everything is shattered into pieces , there’s no use in your helping me any more .
 
Staying with the woman , I’m in good spirits , and then I say: the monthly sum from you will make a capable painter of me . With Sien , I can make the effort and put all my strength into work , but without her I give up .
So that’s the way it is . You have so often shown that you understand me better and treat me infinitely better than others . I hope that this will continue to be the case now . There really is a sympathy between you and me in many things , and it seems to me , Theo , that all your trouble and all my trouble won’t be in vain . You have always gone on helping me , and I’ve always gone on working and now feel new powers developing as I get better . You see , what exists between you and me is , I believe , more serious than that lecture from Tersteeg , and can’t be spoiled by his meddling or that of others . Yet for the sake of peace and good order we must calmly put an end to this meddling . Just excuse me for being rather upset . For the and me it was the first awful hour since we came out of hospital .
 
If you agree , we’ll take no further notice of it , however , and not let ourselves be upset .
But write to us soon , for I’m in great need of a letter from you . I don’t want my head to be full of worry and care , since my getting better depends on keeping calm .
Otherwise I’m getting on well ; the and the are so sweet , so good and quiet that one can’t help cheering up . But Sien changed on the spot when she heard Tersteeg speak — and so did I .
I’ve seen the again , and again have something to take , just to hasten my recovery if possible . Passing water continues to go well , thank God . Nearly normal for several days . And I’m growing stronger ; the chronic fever is getting less .
Now , because of Tersteeg , I want to write to Pa and Ma a little sooner , although I believe later would be preferable . I’ll write as soon as you’ve sent something around the twentieth , although I would rather have waited until they’d finished moving and the woman was stronger . And even now I think it would be much , much better to wait till then , except that Tersteeg might beat me to it . Enclosing the money for the journey for Pa is a sign of my feelings , I believe , and a courtesy from which they’ll understand , I hope , that I appreciate them .
 
So write soon , and if one thing or another proves to be a reason , brother , for us to become more attached and understand and trust each other more , instead of letting us be driven apart through the meddling of Tersteeg or anyone else , then I don’t regret this morning’s unpleasantness . Let me repeat , I make no claim to keep up a social position or to live well . The bare essentials for the are the only expenses she brings with her , and they must be met not by receiving more but by making do ourselves . Because of the love between us , this making do is a joy , so to speak , rather than a burden for her and me . The sense of getting better sets her and me aglow , the desire to be back at work in a very short time and to be entirely absorbed in it .
She’s a very , very sweet mother , so simple , so touching — once you know her . But there was a nasty expression of pain or I don’t know what in her when she heard Tersteeg talking to me and caught a few words . It may be that Tersteeg was like that because he was taken by surprise — still I can’t consider it nice or entirely excuse it .
 
Whatever he may be for others — even now I’m willing to believe that he’s actually better — for me he is insufferable . If Tersteeg had his way , I would be miserable and a lost man . I believe he would very cold-bloodedly watch Sien drown or something , and then claim it was beneficial for civilized society .
As long as I can drown with her , I don’t much care . But we felt sufficiently that her life and my life were one when we saw each other again beside the baby’s cradle in the hospital .
Hallo , brother! But I mustn’t lapse into things like that . It’s healthier to continue thinking calmly about working and getting better , and living quietly day by day .
Sien and I have an agreement , however , in the extreme event that force is used against us . This is that if we can’t live together , at least we can emigrate together . It’s 10 to one that that means certain death if one has no money and isn’t strong , but we’d prefer that to being parted .
There is love between her and me , and promises of mutual loyalty between her and me .
There may be no tampering with this , Theo , for it’s the holiest thing there is in life .
Her wish and mine is that matters shouldn’t take a dramatic
  turn . We’re too full of new zest for life , too full of a desire to work and to plough on , for us not to want to do everything to avoid extremes .
Yet if there were many people — especially you — who felt towards us as Tersteeg does , we couldn’t hold out , and the end would inevitably be tragic . If things stay quiet , we’ll fight our fight here by working , and that may be just everyday and ordinary but it isn’t easy either , and courage and energy are needed to set about it vigorously and keep it up . We came through the whole winter , and with God’s help we’ll get a little further .
I say with God’s help , because I’m grateful to God as well as to you for the help I’ve received and still receive from you .
Tersteeg is an energetic man , but I hope he won’t devote his energy to persecuting Sien and me or anything . Perhaps he’ll realize that he isn’t obliged to interfere , and quietly stay out of it . He doesn’t care about me — I’m really a matter of complete indifference to him — he does it because he thinks he will please or be of service to Uncle Cent or Pa . He doesn’t spare or take the slightest account of my interests or feelings . He comes in here , takes in the breast-feeding the baby with a look that makes her cringe , and without one kind word to her (which you would expect for a mother , even if one doesn’t know her) he says to me
  ‘Is that your model or is it something else?’ You see , that’s neither humane nor tactful .
I may not always be polite to men , but I watch my manners in front of a weak woman . He says nothing about drawings , about the studio , &amp ; c . No , but he does talk about my in Princenhage , about whom I care nothing , whom I have nothing to do with . And about my — immediately taking it for granted a priori that I’m on bad terms with him , whereas in fact relations have long been improving .
Enough now . But write soon , old chap , for I assure you a warm-hearted letter from you helps me more than my pills , &amp ; c . As for my constitution — Tersteeg isn’t my doctor and doesn’t understand my constitution in the slightest — if I need information about that I’ll ask my own doctor , but I never wish to discuss the subject with him again . But there’s no doubt at all that few things can do either the or me more harm than visits like the one we’ve just had . Avoiding them is definitely one of the first rules I must observe . Never has a doctor told me I was in any way abnormal in the tone and the sense in which Tersteeg dared to say it to me this morning . That I couldn’t think or that I wasn’t right in the head . Never in the past , or now , has a doctor said that . I have a nervous constitution , but there’s absolutely no harm in that . With Tersteeg these things become serious insults . The same as with Pa when he wanted to send me to Geel , but more so . I may not let that kind of thing go unchallenged . I long to talk to you about my illness and how that happened and so on . If Tersteeg were to persist in his rash efforts , he would sow a great deal of unrest , that I know for sure . Well , adieu old chap — you know , Sien , when she’s calm , has become so quiet , so fine , so touching a mother , like an etching or drawing or painting by Feyen-Perrin . I long for drawing , for posing , for her and me to be completely better — for order and tranquillity and some sympathy from you above all .
Regards from Sien and a handshake in thought , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
