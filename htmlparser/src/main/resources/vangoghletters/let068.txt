Paris , 2 February 1876 .
My dear Theo ,
Would you do me a great favour? You know that 15-cent edition of ‘Andersen’s vertellingen van de maan’ , translated by the Rev . Ten Kate . Could you send me a copy of it when you get the chance?
It’s only tomorrow that a crate will be going to The Hague in which I’ll enclose the packages in question . The one for Pa can no longer arrive at Etten in time , but send it as soon as possible anyway .
 
I still haven’t had a reply to various letters I wrote in response to advertisements . Nor did Uncle Vincent answer me .
I asked Mr Obach whether any people desiring information about me could apply to him , and His Hon . replied with a very kind letter . At any rate , old boy , we can only continue quietly with our eyes on Him whom we think of when we say ‘Who will shew us any good?’
Adieu , regards to anyone who might ask after me , and ever
Your loving brother .
Vincent
