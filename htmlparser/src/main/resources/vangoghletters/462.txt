Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
A very brief line in haste . My asked me yesterday whether I knew anything more about your visit . I said I knew in general that in all likelihood you’d be coming in October , but no further indication of the date than that . Between ourselves , I tell you that although you’re equally welcome at any time and can be expected at any time — I think that it would suit them at home better in October than in November , say , because I believe that they’re expecting other guests later , for which reason I may perhaps go somewhere else myself for a while in November .
You’ll see from what I say here that it isn’t just me but also my in particular who are counting on you , and it would be a disappointment to us if your visit were to fall through . To the extent that I’d actually regret having written to you like this if it even shortened your visit .
 
The fact that my mentioned it was more a hint to me that certain people who would , I imagine , rather not meet me are coming in November , a hint , I repeat , to me that they wouldn’t take it amiss if I weren’t here in November , for instance , and possibly half of December .
But both they and I are definitely expecting you , and would be disappointed if you didn’t come .
But because I’ve already said that I was intending to go on a trip somewhere else in November , precisely with a view to not getting in anyone’s way , my are counting on it .
So do come in October , and for as long as possible . As you already said in your last letter anyway . But I have to be away during November .
It’s very beautiful here . Just don’t put it off for too long . Regards — with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
It’s actually almighty inconvenient for me not to be able to be here in November , and I imagine I’ll stay in the vicinity anyway , somewhere else in Brabant .
But since I think that they’re expecting guests then , whose custom it is to come at the beginning of the winter until Christmas time , say , I immediately said something myself about a proposed trip that actually wouldn’t have been my intention at all if there’d been no reason for it .
Something else — when you come , come via Eindhoven , writing to tell me which train — then I’ll meet you at Eindhoven station . Then we’ll go together to the man I’m making the decoration for — the 6 canvases I already wrote to you about . This lover is now busy copying them , and all 6 of them are with him . He’s a very nice fellow , a goldsmith by profession , and a chaser of brass and metal for church ornaments &amp ; c .
  I think that if you leave Utrecht early in the morning you’ll be in Eindhoven shortly before or after 12 . That would be the very best time to go there together , and go to Nuenen by train or on foot in the early evening .
