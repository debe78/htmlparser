Letter|My dear Theo ,
Now that the week is over I’m writing to you again . I’ve had a model every day on a regular basis , from morning to evening , and the model is good . Mauve came to have a look , and Mr Tersteeg too , and I’m glad about that .
I’ve been working all this time with watercolour only , and it’s giving me more pleasure every day .
How much I’d like you to be here , I’d have so much to tell and to ask you . Will you come again in the spring? Won’t you know a little in advance?
Now , what I’ve made still isn’t good and is far from being so , but it’s again something different and it’s somewhat stronger and livelier in colour , and without body-colour .
Now I hope that you’ll write to me again soon , and that we’ll definitely try to reach an agreement about the money .
Because although I’d be able to get by on 100 francs a month on my own , it’s a very different matter when I also have to pay and feed my model every day &amp ; c . &amp ; c . And then the cost of paint , paper &amp ; c . I already told you in my last letter that this is what determines whether I can work at full speed or half speed .
  And now that I’m here , all kinds of little expenses crop up every day , and they don’t make life any easier .
Well , for a while I carried on steadily nevertheless , but now I have no money .
It’s natural that when one sets up house somewhere there are all kinds of expenses . But what I win by it is that I feel I’m progressing , and I’ll master the art of watercolour , and it needn’t even take very long before my work is saleable .
Mr Tersteeg himself said something about it , and when I succeed in a small format then I think he’ll buy something . And I’ve worked more on that drawing of that little old woman I sent you a sketch of , and one day it will be sold .
Believe me , I work , I struggle , I swot the whole day , and with pleasure , too , but as it is now I’d also become very discouraged if I couldn’t go on working just as hard or even harder .
 
If you write to Mr Tersteeg about it , he’ll gladly give you credit for an amount you set yourself , and if he wants to he can check and see what I spend it on if he or you don’t trust me . But it would be terrible not to go on working as I have been the last three weeks or so . With regard to the size of the drawings or the subjects , I’ll gladly listen to what Mr T . or Mauve has to say about it . I’ve been working on several large ones recently , because no matter what , I must get over that dry manner in which my studies of this summer were done . And Mauve actually said yesterday evening , although he naturally had some criticism as well , ‘it’s beginning to look like a watercolour’ . Well , if I gain that much , then I reckon I’m squandering neither time nor money . And now that I’ve tried out the handling of the brush and the power of colours in a larger format , I can attempt smaller ones again . As a matter of fact , I have two small ones started , but because I was wrestling with them and sponged part of them out , I started on a really large one . Of which I’m sending you a sketch .
It surprises me a little that you haven’t written to me again , because you’ve written to me only once since I’ve been here , and then only briefly .

And yet it’s very necessary that you write to me soon . Mauve was just here again and I at his place too , he again had this and that to tell me . And Mr Tersteeg was also here and talked about my starting a couple of drawings in a smaller format . Well , so for the coming week , which starts tomorrow , I have work enough but not money enough , I fear , because all I have left is 2 . 50 guilders and a couple of cents . What should I do now? If I were to go to Mauve or Mr Tersteeg and ask them , I don’t think they’d refuse me . But Mauve has done so much already , and I’d rather sell Mr Tersteeg a couple of small drawings , if they succeed , than ask him to lend me money . At least as long as there’s no definite agreement as to where I stand . So answer me soon and , if you will , do either one or the other: send me something to keep me going or write about it to Mr Tersteeg . Theo , I feel an energy in
  me and I’m doing what I can to release it and set it free . I have trouble enough struggling and wrestling with my drawings , and if this were compounded by dreadful worries and I couldn’t keep the models , then I wouldn’t know what to do . It’s awful that you have to pay for it all , but we aren’t as alone as we were last winter , for example . I now feel that I’m on a better path to get results . I’ll do what I can , I’ll work hard and , as soon as I’ve mastered the brush , even harder than I’m now able to . And if we press on with vigour and energy , it won’t be long before you no longer have to send me anything . Well , old chap , keep on doing what you can and I’ll also do what I can . Adieu , I’m counting on your writing soon , you don’t have to send a lot all at once , if only I can go on from week to week . Accept a handshake in thought ,
Ever yours ,
Vincent
