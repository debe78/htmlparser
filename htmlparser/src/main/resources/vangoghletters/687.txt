Letter|My dear Theo ,
I have to thank you very much for Tasset’s consignment of canvases and colours , which arrived in good condition and this time in postal parcels .
I already told you in my last letter that autumn had shown itself in rain and bad weather . That inconvenienced me a bit , but in the sunny intervals I still managed to finish a no . 30 canvas of ploughed fields .
[sketch A]
A blue sky with white clouds . An immense field of an ashy lilac , furrows , innumerable clods of earth , the horizon of blue hills and green bushes and small farmsteads with orange-coloured roofs .
  It’s another of those that’ll take a long time to dry ; with impasto paintings you have to do the same as with the strongest wine , it has to ferment . So I’ve ordered a frame in white deal for that one .
As long as autumn lasts I won’t have enough hands , canvas or colours to paint the beautiful things that I see . I’m also working on the portrait of Milliet , but he poses badly , or else it’s my fault , which I don’t believe , however , because I badly need some studies of him because he’s good-looking , very jaunty , very easy-going in his appearance , and he’d suit me down to the ground for a painting of lovers .
I’ve already promised him a study for his trouble , but there you are , he can’t keep still .
On top of that , he hardly has any time , since he’ll have to say his tender farewells to all the tarts and other pond-life in the Arles stewpond , now that his prick has gone back to the garrison , as he puts it .
I don’t object to that at all ; however , I regret that he has a nervous movement in his legs when he poses . He’s a good lad , but he’s only 25 years old , 10 fewer than me for Christ’s sake — and in ten years — according to Ziem , I’m afraid if he carries on like that , being unable to get a hard-on any more , he may join the ambitious .
 
I shouldn’t be surprised if deep down he was annoyed at having to leave , and perhaps he’s exceeding his budget and that’s the reason he’s forced to go back to Africa . I know only one serious fault in him , that’s liking Mr Georges Ohnet’s L’abbé Constantin , and I’ve told him that he would do a thousand times better to read Guy de Maupassant’s Bel-ami .
What does père Tanguy say now about coarse colours?
I think I should warn you right away that I’ll need another 5 or even 10 metres of canvas .
And that at the same time I’ll also need
tubes like the silver
zinc white ,   of Prussian blue

 	 	tubes Geranium Lake
white , large tubes
   , ,
That’s approximately in proportion to the canvas .
As I’ve just received the consignment of both canvas and colours , you’ll understand how little urgency there is ,
  but that’s only the minimum of what I calculate I’ll need during the autumn and leaf-fall , which will surely be amazing and which , as you know , lasts only a week . I’m sure I’ll be able to get some good work done then , and I wouldn’t like to be right out of yellow and blue at that time .
In case you’re hard up , I can manage perfectly well without the expensive blues and the carmine . 1 tube of Prussian blue goes as far as 6 ultramarine or cobalt and costs 3 times less .
Now , it fades to a certain extent , but by using zinc white and using it unmixed , I can do without the rest , if it comes to it .
Delacroix swore by that vulgar blue , and used it a lot .
So I’m alerting you to this state of affairs , although we’re a good way away from that famous leaf-fall . As long as the autumn lasts , I need to work like a team of mules if I want to recoup what our furnishing has cost .
 
I wanted to do more sunflowers too , but they were already over . Yes , during the autumn I’d very much like to do a dozen or so square no . 30 canvases , and that may very well be achieved , as far as I can see .
I have a terrible clarity of mind at times , when nature is so lovely these days , and then I’m no longer aware of myself and the painting comes to me as if in a dream . I am indeed somewhat fearful that that will have its reaction in melancholy when the bad season comes , but I’ll try to get away from it by studying this question of drawing figures from memory . I’m always frustrated in my best abilities by the lack of models , but I don’t dwell on it — I do landscape and colour without worrying where that will take me . I know this , that if I went to beg models: but please pose for me , I beseech you , I would be behaving like Zola’s good painter in L’oeuvre . And certainly Manet , for example , didn’t do that . And Zola doesn’t say in his book what those people did who saw nothing supernatural in the painting .
But let’s not criticize Zola’s book . I’ll send you five drawings by Bernard , of the same kind as the others .
 
I wrote to him that , Gauguin not having stated categorically whether he’ll come or not come , I couldn’t offer Bernard hospitality for free , or even paid for with paintings or drawings .
That his board alone here would , in any case , cost him a little more than board and lodging at the place where he is at present . Unless , though , we were to make savings eating at the studio , with or without Gauguin .
But that in any case , I wasn’t urging him to come . That , as I definitely plan to spend the winter here , his company would of course be very welcome to me , but that above all , it was important that he do his sums carefully .
If in the next few days , Gauguin writes to you categorically , either to you or to me , we could still see about Bernard . It seems to me that it would definitely suit Bernard’s book here , but his father would have to be a touch more magnanimous towards him . Because Bernard takes pains . However , I don’t like these drawings as much as the previous ones .
At the beginning of next month there’ll be another heap of things falling on my back all together:
  the frames and stretching frames that I’m having made here for the decoration of the house , at the same time as the month’s rent and the charwoman .
But I can put off taking delivery of the frames and stretching frames , and so I’ll get by , I hope , in any case .
The only hope I have is that by working really hard , by the end of a year I’ll have enough paintings to be able to show myself — if I wish , or if you so desire — at that time of the exhibition . I’m not keen on it , but what I’m certainly keen on is to show you something that isn’t entirely bad .
I would not exhibit , but should we have work by me in the house that would prove that we’re neither cowards nor idlers , I’d be content . But the main thing seems to me to be that I shouldn’t put myself to less trouble than painters who work specifically for that .
Whether we exhibit , whether we don’t exhibit , we must be productive , and after that we have the right to smoke our pipe in peace .
But this year we’ll be productive , and I’m doing all I can to make sure that the new series is better than the first two consignments .
And among the studies there’ll be some , I hope , that may be paintings , that is , . . .
For the starry sky , I still very much hope to paint it , and perhaps one of these evenings I’ll be in the same ploughed field , if the sky is twinkling brightly .
Tolstoy’s book , Ma religion , was published in French as long ago as 1885 , but I’ve never seen it in any catalogue .
  He doesn’t seem to believe much in resurrection , either of the body or of the soul . In particular , he seems not to believe much in heaven — so he argues things like a nihilist — but — in a certain sense in opposition to them — he attaches great importance to doing well whatever one does , since that’s probably all one has . And even if he doesn’t believe in resurrection , he appears to believe in the equivalent — the continuance of human life — the march of humanity , the man and the work almost inevitably carried on by the humanity of the next generation . In short , it mustn’t be ephemeral consolations that he offers . A gentleman himself , he became a manual worker , knows how to make boots , knows how to mend stoves , knows how to handle a plough and dig the earth . Now I know nothing about any of that , but I know how to respect a human soul with enough energy to remake itself like that . Dear God , we’ve well and truly no reason to complain about living in times when there seem to be nothing but idlers , when we live at the same time as such specimens of poor mortals who don’t even believe very strongly in heaven itself .
He believes — I’ve perhaps written you it already , in non-violent revolution , through the need for love and religious feeling which must manifest itself in people as a reaction against scepticism and desperate and appalling suffering .
More soon . As your last letter was on Friday , if I had your next news by Friday as well , that would be darned good . But there’s no hurry , it’ll be fine just as it turns out . Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
