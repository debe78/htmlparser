Letter|Tuesday afternoon
Dear Mr de Zwart,
I am sorry that you came to see me yesterday and did not find me at home — I did not know you intended to come that day.
Now I hear from Giesenberg that in all likelihood you will be coming to Schenkweg again tomorrow (Wednesday). I shall certainly stay at home tomorrow, because I should like to speak to you about one thing and another to do with some minor alterations.
Yours respectfully.
Your servant
Vincent van Gogh
