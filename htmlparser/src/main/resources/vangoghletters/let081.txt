Letter|Ramsgate , 6 May 1876
My dear Theo ,
Herewith you’ll find the 2 books I promised you . I’ve marked a few things in them , but you’ll certainly find many beautiful things in addition to these . As I wrote to you already , though , one starts to grow especially fond of them when one lives in the country itself .
It’s already Saturday evening again ; the weather’s beautiful today: the sea is very calm and it’s low tide at the moment , the sky is a delicate whitish blue with a haze in the distance . Early this morning it was also beautiful , everything was clear , where now it’s more or less hazy .
This town has something very singular , one notices the sea in everything ; but you know this special quality , too , because one finds it in The Hague and Scheveningen as well . Did you know that Anna
  has received an answer to her advertisements? This week she sent me 3 letters she’d received . I’m longing to hear what she’s decided . One of the letters came from Amsterdam , a situation as companion to an old lady , another letter was from Vaals and yet another from here in England . She may have received even more since then .
She seems awfully eager for an opportunity to come into contact with families ; in Amsterdam she would find this at once through Uncle Cor and Uncle Stricker .
Do you still visit Uncle Cor now and then? Sometimes I long to see him so much ; just yesterday I wrote to him . Keep him as your friend , there can’t be any harm in that . Sometime you must tell Mr Tersteeg about the school here . These are really happy days , the ones I’m spending here , day
  after day , and yet it’s a happiness and peacefulness that I don’t trust entirely , though one thing can lead to another .
A person isn’t easily satisfied , one moment he finds things far too good and the next he’s not satisfied enough . But I’m saying this by the by , we would do better not to talk about it , but rather continue quietly on our way . Have a good Sunday morning , and give my regards to everyone at Rooses’ , also to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy , and in thought a handshake from
Your loving brother
Vincent
