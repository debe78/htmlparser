My dear Theo ,
There may well come a time when I look back with a certain nostalgia on the ‘excesses of Egypt’ connected with other situations , namely earning more money and being in many respects of more consequence in the world – this I foresee . There is however ‘bread enough and to spare’ in the houses I’ll be visiting as I continue down the road I’ve taken , but not money to spare .
And yet I so clearly see light in the distance , and if that light disappears now and then it’s mostly my own fault .
It’s very questionable whether I’ll go far in this profession , whether those 6 years spent in the firm of Messrs Goupil &amp ; Co . , during which I should have been training for this situation , won’t always be a thorn in my flesh , as it were .
 
I believe , however , that on no account can I turn back now , even if part of me should wish to (later , this isn’t the case now) . These days it seems to me that there are no situations in the world other than those ranging from schoolmaster to clergyman and everything in between: missionary , ‘London missionary’ &amp ; c . &amp ; c .
Being a London missionary is rather special , I believe ; one has to go around among the workers and the poor spreading God’s word and , if one has some experience , speak to them , track down and seek to help foreigners looking for work , or other people who are in some sort of difficulty , etc . etc . Last week I was in London a couple of times to find out if there’s a possibility of my becoming one . Because I speak various languages and have tended to associate , especially in Paris and London , with people from the poorer classes and foreigners , and being a foreigner myself , I may well be suited
  to this , and could become so more and more .
To do this , however , one has to be at least 24 years old , and so in any case I still have a year to wait .
Mr Stokes says he definitely cannot give me a salary , for he can get plenty of people who’ll work for board and lodging alone , which is certainly true . But can that be kept up for long? I’m afraid not ; it will be decided soon enough .
But , old boy , no matter what the case , I think I can tell you this again , that these couple of months have bound me so closely to the sphere ranging from schoolmaster to clergyman , both through satisfactions associated with those situations and through thorns that have pricked me , that I can no longer turn back .
Onward , then! But I can assure you that very distinct difficulties will present themselves very soon , and others are visible on the horizon , and as if one is in a different world from the firm of Messrs Goupil &amp ; Co .
Will I be getting the small engravings (like those Pa and Ma have) of Christus Consolator and Remunerator that you promised me? Write soon if you can find a moment , but send your letter to Pa and Ma , because my address may change soon and Pa and Ma will be the first to know .
 
Last week I was at Hampton Court to see the splendid gardens and long avenues of chestnut and lime trees where masses of crows and rooks have their nests , and also to see the palace and the paintings . There are , among other things , many portraits by Holbein which are very beautiful , and two beautiful Rembrandt (the portrait of his wife and one of a rabbi) , and also beautiful Italian portraits by Bellini , Titian , a painting by Leonardo da Vinci , cartoons by Mantegna , a beautiful painting by S . Ruysdael , fruit by Cuyp and so on and so forth .
I rather wished that you could have been there too ; it was a pleasure to see paintings again .
And I couldn’t help thinking vividly of the people who have lived at Hampton Court , of Charles i and wife (she was the one who said ‘I thank Thee , God , for having made me Queen , though an unhappy Queen’ , and at whose graveside Bossuet spoke from the abundance of his heart . Do you have ‘Bossuet , Oraisons funèbres’ , you’ll find that eulogy there , there’s a very cheap edition , 50 centimes , I think) , and also of Lord and Lady Russell , who would certainly have gone there often . (Guizot described their life in L’amour dans le mariage . Read that sometime if you can get hold of it . ) Herewith a feather from one of the rooks there .
Do write soon if you can , I’m longing to hear from you , and believe me , after a handshake in thought
Your loving brother
Vincent
Despite my feeling that I am inadequate and that in many respects I lack the qualifications necessary for the situation I have and for the related situation I have my eye on , I nevertheless have at the same time such a feeling of thankfulness , of hope and of something like deliverance! and freedom! despite all kinds of bonds , and the thought of God – despite new shortcomings that occur to me – stays with me more strongly and longer .
