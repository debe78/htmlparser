Letter|My dear Theo ,
What you write about has literally not been out of my thoughts since I received your letter . And I’m writing again precisely because the matter preoccupies me so much . In cases like this one is faced by a patient who is ill in both body and soul . So it’s doubly serious . And financial help with the necessities of life etc . isn’t enough to bring about complete recovery , for the very best and most effective medicine is still love and a home . At least that’s what I felt last winter , and since then — now , for instance — far more so , precisely because the experience made clear to me what my feelings were also telling me . Maintaining a life above water is a great and fine thing , but it’s also very difficult and requires a lot of care . Making a home for the homeless , well , that’s something that must be good , whatever the world may say , it cannot be wrong . And yet it’s often seen as some sort of crime .
I couldn’t help thinking and thinking again about it . How will people take it? Will it bring you into conflict with the world? That , too , is a question in my mind that I can’t answer , because I don’t yet know the circumstances well enough . And there’s something else , which is actually the reason for this letter and which I wanted to suggest you consider and which you’ve probably thought of yourself .
Something like this is a long-term business . But I do think it possible that you’ll soon see the reward for your care , although the complete recovery in body and soul of a constitution that has had such a shock really is something
  that will take years .
The and the are with me at the moment . There’s a big difference when I think back to last year . The woman is stronger and sturdier , has lost a great , a very great deal of that harried look . The little child is as charming , healthy and cheerful a little fellow as you can imagine . He crows like a cockerel — has nothing but the breast yet is fat and plump .
And the poor little — you can see from the drawing that the deep misery of the past hasn’t been wiped away yet , and I often worry about that , but still , she’s already very different from last year — then it was very , very bad , and now there’s already something truly childlike in her .
Anyway , though not yet completely normal , the situation is better than I would have dared hope for last year . And when I now reflect , would it have been better if the had had a miscarriage , or if the had withered and wasted away for lack of mother’s milk , and if that had been left more and more unclean and neglected , and the woman herself in who knows what wretched , near indescribable state? — see , then I may not hesitate and I say , onward in good heart . Something simple — truly motherly — is coming in the woman , and as that strengthens she will be saved .
 
And how is progress made??? Not through doctors or through unusual remedies . Through the sense of one’s own home , through a regular , motivated life . Not by sparing oneself a great deal , for that cannot be done , but because the harried heart has more rest , even during hard and tedious work . With this case that I know intimately before me as a reality , I come back to what I wanted to say . It seems to me that you should pay special attention to the surroundings of the you write about if you want to see some benefit . It would be desirable for her to be somewhere other than in an empty room in a hotel or something like that , and for her to be in more domestic surroundings . Think about this , for I believe it’s an important thing . She needs to be distracted by very ordinary everyday things that keep her occupied .
Solitude or idleness is absolutely fatal . She should be able to talk to good people . In short , a domestic circle with nothing out of the ordinary would be wonderful . Occupy herself with children , say . I think it rather a pity that she has no child , in my view that makes the case even more critical .
 
Yes , I believe that the most practical thing you can do is to put her in a domestic circle . I believe that the main consideration for you at the moment is — this life must be saved — and that unselfishly you think more of her than of yourself . For my part , last year I knew of only one home for , namely with me , and if I could have done something else I wouldn’t have taken her into my house immediately , precisely in order to avoid unpleasantnesses that couldn’t then be avoided . Unable to do otherwise , I didn’t hesitate though . And all in all everything has gone well so far . But with you the position is different , and perhaps you can take , the person you write about , somewhere for the time being where she’ll be calm and safe until she’s fully recovered . I fear that it may be a long-term business , her recovery , and moreover , if it can be avoided one needn’t sin against society’s prejudices , which simply do exist . If it can’t be avoided , then what carries most weight must outweigh the rest , and this summer I would rather have sinned against all possible prejudices , even if there were more , than leave the woman without a roof and a hearth . But in your case everything can and should take place more calmly , it seems to me , and if I were you I’d provide her with a solid home . Not alone in a room , with no company . For her own good , and not because you want to spirit her away or keep her concealed , but for her it’s essential that emotions and shocking things are avoided as far as possible , and the sooner she’s in normal , everyday occupations and surroundings , the better .
 
Well , if you could take in immediately , I wouldn’t speak of it . Yet I fear that’s not possible and you yourself wouldn’t immediately agree .
I’m very agitated and I think of you all the time . Just now I did another drawing for which the posed . Listen , old chap , to put it briefly , it has been my experience this year that while there are hard , very hard , moments of care and trouble , it’s infinitely better to live with a woman and children than without .
So if you continue to think that this person is the for whom you want to live , I regard it as a happy thing for you . And then it’s precisely through love persevered with that she will bloom again . But it’s always desirable to get to know each other first , that’s more orderly and more prudent . And I too would have done that if it could have been arranged , even though I thought , I’ll stay with this person for ever . But there was no home immediately open to her except mine . Anyway , it’s the circumstances that one must take into account , and sometimes one can’t avoid giving offence . I don’t in the least want to advise you to give it up , since you write that you love her , but I believe we agree that it’s good to be careful vis-à-vis the world , which otherwise sometimes ruins everything .
 
And so , be careful . For the present the recovery is the main concern , and the other is secondary . Well then , I believe nothing will be better for than to spend each day in a quiet circle . Don’t you know someone among your friends who would be willing to help and take her in for the time being?
For , I repeat , if she’s alone in a room , with no distraction or occupation , then I believe that could be quite fatal for her . And a kind of hospital (ordinary or private) where she had company would perhaps be preferable , provided you visited her often . It may be that all this has already been arranged ; I write about it just because I don’t know anything definite in this regard .
I wish I knew when you were coming . If you come and are able , bring the old studies with you . As for my writing to ask whether you could send me a little more , well , I’m a little worried and wish it was possible , but don’t let go short for my sake . And be assured that because of what you write I’ll gladly redouble my efforts to make progress , so that the burden on you is lightened . But that’s just the thing: working hard sometimes actually costs money , because one has more outgoings . Write soon , for I’m truly longing for news of you . My blessing in everything . Rappard is getting better , I have a letter from him . I’m busy with work , still doing various Heads . Adieu , with a handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
You’ll say that I’m spending a lot of time writing , I can’t help it , for you’ve confided in me , so I want to tell you that this didn’t fail to touch me .
It’s an odd thing about cases of this kind that it’s so extremely difficult to know how far one should go . You will experience this too . One asks oneself , should I help this woman and otherwise see only a friend in her , or should I definitely choose this woman as my wife with whom I want to live always? Is she the one? Or is she not?
You see , I believe that you haven’t avoided this conflict , or perhaps you’re still in it . For were it to be otherwise , it would seem to me rather unnatural .
At any rate I felt that conflict , and it was so difficult that for my part I couldn’t entirely answer those questions when circumstances forced me to make a decision . Because I thought , I don’t have the means to maintain two separate households , but perhaps I have enough for one , and so I must tell her how things stand: what I might be able to do and what I certainly couldn’t do . Perhaps we’ll be able to get by together , but if we don’t live together I won’t have enough . With you it may take a different form while still being the same conflict , and I remember a remark of yours last year that I thought very right and true: ‘marrying is such a funny thing’ . Yes , by Jove , it certainly is . You said to me then , don’t marry her , and I conceded to you that the circumstances were such that there was good reason not to speak of that for the time being .
  And now you know that I haven’t spoken further of that , but also that and I have remained true to each other . And precisely because I can’t say that you were wrong when you said ‘don’t marry her’ , I ask you to consider these words of yours , and indeed believe that you’ve thought about them , for it isn’t I who says this but you yourself . And I remind you of this only because I believe that it was indeed good that it didn’t happen immediately .
So don’t let go of this thought , for it’s good for love to ripen so that marrying becomes very much a secondary matter . That is safer , and no one suffers harm as a result .
I wanted to say one thing to you in the beginning , which you’ll understand anyway . Whether or not this puts you in difficulties , I respect the noble feelings that prompted you to help , and because I respect that I hope that if you do run up against difficulties , large or small , you’ll think me worthy of your confidence .
Yet I do NOT view the matter with melancholy , but with every hope of a good outcome , namely happiness for you and for .
But once again — I consider it likely that a crisis will come sooner or later , consisting of a kind of mutual disappointment — if there was a child , it would be like a lightning conductor for the two of you . Now there isn’t one in your case and so , above all when the crisis comes — not now but later — trust me then and talk to me . See , for that’s where there are rocks where many a love has foundered alas and could have been saved . Once one has surmounted those rocks there’s plain sailing ahead . Although I’m busy writing to you , I’m busy working too . I can’t say how much I long to discuss many things with you . Tomorrow I’ll be getting a sou’wester for the heads . Heads of fishermen , old and young , that’s what I’ve been thinking about for a long time and I had already done one , but then later I couldn’t get hold of a sou’wester again . Now I’m going to have one of my own , an old one that many gales and seas have swept over .
