Letter|My dear Theo ,
In my last letter you’ll have found a little scratch of that perspective frame . I’ve just come back from the blacksmith , who has put iron spikes on the legs and iron corners on the frame .
It consists of two long legs:
The frame is fixed to them by means of strong wooden pegs , either horizontally or vertically .
The result is that on the beach or in a meadow or a field you have a view as if through a window . The perpendicular and horizontal lines of the frame , together with the diagonals and the cross — or otherwise a grid of squares — provide a clear guide to some of the principal features , so that one can make a drawing with a firm hand , setting out the broad outlines and proportions . Assuming , that is , that one has a feeling for perspective and an understanding of why and how perspective appears to change the direction of lines and the size of masses and planes . Without that , the frame is little or no help , and makes your head spin when you look through it .
I expect you can imagine how delightful it is to train this view-finder on the sea , on the green fields — or in the winter on snow-covered land or in the autumn on the fantastic network of thin and thick trunks and branches , or on a stormy sky .
 
With CONSIDERABLE practice and with lengthy practice , it enables one to draw at lightning speed and , once the lines are fixed , to paint at lightning speed .
It’s in fact especially good for painting , because a brush must be used for sky , ground , sea . Or , rather , to render them through drawing alone , it’s necessary to know and feel how to work with the brush . I also firmly believe my drawing would be strongly influenced if I were to paint for a while . I tried it back in January but that came to a halt — the reason for stopping , apart from a few other things , was that I was still too hesitant when drawing . Now six months have passed , devoted entirely to drawing . So now I’m beginning anew with fresh heart . The frame really has become an excellent piece of equipment — it’s a pity you still haven’t seen it . It has cost me a pretty penny , too , but I had it made so solidly that I shan’t wear it out in a hurry . On Monday I’ll start doing large charcoal drawings with it , as well as painting small studies — if those two things come off , I hope that better painted work will soon follow .
So by the time you next come to see me I would like the studio to have become a real painter’s studio . The fact that I couldn’t get going in January — you know that there were various reasons for that , but in the end it can be seen as a fault in the machine , a screw or a rod that wasn’t strong enough and had to be replaced by a stronger one .
Another thing I’ve bought for myself is a tough , warm pair of trousers , and , since I bought a pair of sturdy shoes just before you came , I’m now fully prepared to face the elements . At the same time my aim is to learn a couple of things about technique through this landscape painting which I feel I’m in need of for my FIGURES , namely rendering different fabrics , and the tone and colour . In a word , the expression of the body — the mass — of things . It’s as a result of your visit that I’m moving on to this , but before you came not a day passed without my thinking about it along these lines . But I would have gone on for longer with just black and white and the outline . But there’s no turning back now . Adieu , old chap , again a warm handshake , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
