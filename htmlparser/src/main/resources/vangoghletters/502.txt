Letter|My dear Theo ,
Many thanks for your letter and for the 50 francs enclosed , which was very welcome to me this month in particular , what with the move . I think that I’ll save a very great deal of time in the long run by living in the studio , since I’ll be able to get started first thing in the morning , for instance , whereas the way it was at home I couldn’t do anything .
I’ve been slogging away at drawings these last few days . The old tower in the fields is being demolished . There was a sale of woodwork and slates and old iron , including the cross .
I’ve finished a watercolour of it in the manner of that timber sale , but better , I think . I also had a second large watercolour of the churchyard , which has so far been a failure .
But still , I have a very good idea of what I want in it — and perhaps I’ll now get what I mean on the third sheet of paper . And if not , then not . I’ve just now sponged out the two failures , but I’m going to try it once more .
 
If you want , though , you can have the one of the sale .
Then I’m working on a large study of a cottage in the evening .
And about 6 heads .
One thing and another was the reason I didn’t send you confirmation of the receipt of your letter before .
I’m working as hard as I can because I’m thinking of going to see the Antwerp exhibition sometime with that of mine in Eindhoven , if I can manage it . And then I’d want to take some work with me so as to do something more with it there if possible . I’m longing to hear whether Mr Portier has seen the potato eaters .
What you say about the figures is true , that as figures they aren’t like the heads are . I’ve therefore thought about starting it very differently , that is tackling it from the torsos instead of from the heads .
But then it would have become something altogether different .
As to sitting , though , don’t forget
  that these people certainly don’t sit on chairs like in one of Duval’s cafés , say .
The finest thing I saw was that the woman was simply kneeling — that’s in the first sketch that I sent you .
But anyway , it’s simply painted the way it’s painted , and we’ll do it again sometime — and then certainly not the same . The last few days I’ve also been busy drawing little figures .
Thanks , too , for the No . of Le Temps you sent with Paul Mantz’s article about the Salon . I haven’t seen such a good article in a long time . I think it uncommonly good — the opening sentences — the painting of those Laplanders in their dark hut , who see the sun rise after the long winter night — how in art one also sits waiting for light .
Then immediately afterwards his reference to Millet , who has certainly given new light — ‘and who remains’ .
Then pointing to Lhermitte as Millet’s successor — I think all of it manly language , and outstanding in accuracy and broad view .
 
Except I think it a shame that he calls Roll ‘a beginner’ — for that’s to denigrate him , and Roll has already made so many fine things and is — matchless .
Already matchless since his Miners’ strike at least . When Paul Mantz says that Roll’s labourers don’t work very hard , and that it is ‘a dream’ . Well now — it’s a nice conceit and there’s something to it . The only thing is that it’s precisely because it’s Paris , and not the down-to-earth work in the fields . After all , a workman in the city is just exactly the way Roll paints him .
Rappard has a painting in Antwerp that I think will be very fine , at least the sketch , which practically no one liked , was to my mind very good . I think he’s very clever .
Have you finished Zola’s book , Germinal , yet? I’d very much like to read it and will send it back within a fortnight or so . Is Lhermitte’s month of May in yet?
In Mantz’s article I also think what he manages to say about colour in 4 words very good and logical , when he talks about ‘the ash blues that we love’ , and ‘the grass of the meadow is very green , the bull is russet brown , the young girl is pink , here is the harmony of 3 tones’ , when he talks about the same question in regard to Lhermitte .
Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
I can understand that Besnard must be interesting .
 
I’ll add another word or two here — I cannot advise you enough to work out E . Delacroix’s different propositions about colour for yourself .
Although — out of touch — although out of the art world for a long time — turned out — because of my clogs &amp ; c . — yet I see from that article by Mantz that there are still connoisseurs and art lovers , even now , who — know something — and that is what Thoré , what Théophile Gautier knew . And that , leaving aside the self-styled more civilized world of progress for what it is , namely a deception , it continues to come down to what the reformers already announced about taste in ’48 , for instance , in a manly and forceful way .
Just as Israëls won’t be surpassed here in Holland but , it seems to me , will remain the master . And in Belgium , Leys and Degroux .
Don’t , whatever you do , make the mistake of thinking that I’m insisting on imitation , because I don’t mean that at all .
 
You’ve seen much more than I have — and I wish that I’d seen what you’ve seen and are still looking at every day .
But perhaps seeing a great deal is precisely what makes it difficult to reflect . Anyway .
My assertion is just that it’s the same with you as with a mass of others , that when you’re older you have to repeat the ground rules once more and study them again . I mean that in your capacity as an art expert you have to know certain rules of colour mixing and perspective just as well as the painters themselves — in terms of theory even better than them actually — since you have to advise and speak about paintings in the making . Don’t take it amiss , for what I say is true ; that this would be of more practical use to you than you might think , and would raise you above the usual standard of dealers . Which is necessary , because the usual standard is below standard . I do know a little from my own experience what the dealers know and what they don’t know .
I believe that they’re often taken in and make deals that they later regret , precisely because they know too little about how a painting is made . Anyway — I know you’re already taking pains — for example by reading good things like the one by Gigoux . Really study the subject of colour etc . for yourself . I’m trying to do it myself too , and I’d also like to read everything you find of that nature . These days I’m working on putting what Delacroix said about drawing into practice on drawing a hand and arm: don’t start from the line but from the middle . One has opportunity enough to start from ovals there . And what I’m trying to get with it is to be able to draw not a hand but the gesture , not a mathematically correct head but the overall expression . The sniffing of the wind when a digger looks up , say , or speaking . Life , in short .
