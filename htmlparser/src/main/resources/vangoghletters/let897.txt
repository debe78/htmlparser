My dear Vincent ,
Thanks very much for your letter . Fortunately mine brings you good news of the one . After a few days of suffering he has started to be jolly again and no longer to cry so much . It’s thanks to the good ass’s milk we’re currently giving him . The animals come to the door , and in the morning he receives warm milk , always
  from the same animal . Afterwards there’s still enough for two doses , which he receives alternately with his mother’s milk , which is now coming in abundance . He looks extremely well at the moment . He must take the ass’s milk for at least a fortnight , and so we can’t go to Pissarro’s on 14 July . So I’ve taken that day to go to see Claude Monet with Valadon , who will certainly get on my nerves on that day , but I’m content to go and see the new works by Monet . There’s no reason for you to put back your arrival , not that we don’t appreciate that you wanted
  to come and share my pains , on the contrary , thank you , but with a patient , the fewer people there are around the better it is . So come if you like on Sunday with the first train , in the morning you’ll see Walpole Brooke , who’s coming to see your paintings at Tanguy’s , next a Japanese Buddha which I saw in a curio shop , and after that we’re going to have lunch at our place to see your studies . You can stay with us as long as you want , and you can give us advice on the arrangement of our new apartment . Dries and Annie will probably come to the ground floor , and they’ll have a little garden which we , naturally , will have the benefit of . If the two women
  get on with each other it promises well . Perhaps good that Dries will come to our place . I’m having a lot of luck in business , even if I haven’t sold paintings for 800 , 000 , 000 , 000 francs , but among other things I’ve sold two Gauguin , for which I’ve sent him the amount . Pissarro wrote to me that he wasn’t able to pay his rent , I’m going to send him a little advance on the business we’ll do . You see , his exhibition really brought him in something , but still just to plug the holes . He’s had an abscess on the eye . Poor old chap! Good-day to you brother , we’re counting on seeing you on Sunday . Warm regards from Jo , and the one is smiling at you like before he was ill . Good handshake from your brother who loves you .
Theo
Regards to Dr Gachet and his family .
The croquis of the landscape à la Michel is promising , and the portrait must be superb .
