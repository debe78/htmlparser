Letter|My dear Theo,
During the journey I thought at least as much about you as about the new country I was seeing.
But I tell myself that you‘ll perhaps come here often yourself later on. It seems to me almost impossible to be able to work in Paris, unless you have a refuge in which to recover and regain your peace of mind and self-composure. Without that, you‘d be bound to get utterly numbed.
Now I‘ll tell you that for a start, there‘s been a snowfall of at least 60 centimetres all over, and it‘s still snowing.
Arles doesn‘t seem any bigger than Breda or Mons to me.
Before reaching Tarascon I noticed some magnificent scenery — huge yellow rocks, oddly jumbled together, with the most imposing shapes.
In the small valleys between these rocks there were
  rows of little round trees with olive-green or grey-green foliage, which could well be lemon trees.
But here in Arles the land seems flat.
I noticed some magnificent plots of red earth planted with vines, with mountains in the background of the most delicate lilac. And the landscape under the snow with the white peaks against a sky as bright as the snow was just like the winter landscapes the Japanese did.
Here‘s my address
Restaurant Carrel
30 rue Cavalerie
Arles
So far I‘ve taken no more than a little walk round the town, as I was more or less completely done in last night.
I‘ll write to you soon — an antique dealer whose shop I went into yesterday in this very street was telling me he knew of a Monticelli.
With a good handshake to you and the pals.
Yours truly,
Vincent
