My dear Theo,
Thanks for the information you got. We’re now staying a day longer and will arrive in London on Wednesday morning.
I gave you the photo in the Forbes catalogue here already, because I thought it would interest you, being the Scheldt and therefore Belgium. It’s of a painting by Cap. It’s not so very beautiful, but at least it’s original. I’ll write to you soon from London. I wish you well.
Vincent.
