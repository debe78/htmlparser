My dear Mr Vincent ,
I have just returned from Lambesc to see the family . I hasten to tell you that I found them all in good health . My is very well , Armand , our blacksmith , I have realized by myself that he has been striking the iron hard , his bosses are very pleased with him . Camille had his first communion last Sunday , and I gave them the pleasant surprise of arriving on Monday evening at 6 o’clock . Beautiful Marcelle is still doing well , she has two teeth , she is an extraordinary little one , very well-behaved , she has everything in her favour , only when I arrived she didn’t want to see me . It was only when I left that she really looked at me and pulled my beard a little . I am very satisfied with my journey , one must hope that we shall all be reunited in Marseille at Michaelmas , for I have rented an apartment for that period . I arrived Tuesday evening at midnight in Marseille . When I got up this morning , Wednesday , my handed me your letter , which satisfied me to learn that you had left Arles
  to go to St-Rémy of your own accord . Continue your paintings , you are in a beautiful part of the world , the countryside is very beautiful , the soil is very well worked , you will find a great change in the farming down there , you will not find gardens that look like cemeteries , as in Arles . Continue to take good care of yourself , follow properly the good advice which will be given to you by the good Doctor who is attached to the establishment . I have great confidence that your health will be completely restored , with the good will that you have you will succeed in doing very fine paintings , you live in the garden of the Bouches du Rhône , you will not lack for models made by nature , continue and be of good heart .
We talked at length about you with my on the subject of my last journey to Arles . When I write to her that I have received one of your letters that will give her great pleasure . This very day I am going to tell her about it .
Please , Mr Vincent , accept my regards as well as those of my family , and a caress from Marcelle who , thanks to you , can say hello to my Portrait evening and morning , for they are hanging in the alcove where she sleeps , she rests in peace under the benevolent gaze of both the wife and the Father .
I shake both your hands affectionately .
Your entirely devoted
Roulin .

My regards to your esteemed brother when you write to him .
