Letter|My dear Vincent
I’m very late in replying to you ; but what can I say , my sickly state and my worries often leave me in a state of prostration , in which I sink into inaction . If you were familiar with my life you would understand that after having struggled so much (in every way) I’m in the process of drawing breath , and at the moment I’m lying dormant . Your idea for an exchange , to which I haven’t yet replied , appeals to me , and I’ll do the portrait you want , but not yet . I’m not in a fit state to do it , seeing that it’s not a copy of a face that you want , but a portrait as I understand it .
  I’m studying young Bernard , and I don’t have him yet . I shall perhaps do it from memory , but in any case it will be an abstraction . Perhaps tomorrow , I don’t know , it will come to me all at once . At the moment there’s a spell of fine weather which is leading us both to try lots of things .
I’ve just done a religious painting , very badly done , but which was interesting to do , and which I like . I wanted to give it to the church at Pont-Aven . They don’t want it , of course .
Breton women , grouped together , are praying ; costumes very intense black . The yellow-white bonnets very luminous .
  The two bonnets on the right are like monstrous helmets . An apple tree goes across the canvas: dark purple , and the foliage drawn in masses like emerald green clouds , with yellow-green interstices of sunlight . The earth (pure vermilion) . At the church it goes down and becomes red brown .
The angel is dressed in violent ultramarine blue , and Jacob in bottle green . The angel’s wings pure no . 1 chrome yellow . The angel’s hair no . 2 chrome , and the feet flesh-orange . I believe I’ve achieved a great rustic and superstitious simplicity in the figures . The whole
  very severe . The cow under the tree is tiny by comparison with reality , and is prancing . For me , the landscape and the wrestling exist only in the imagination of the people at prayer after the sermon ; that’s why there’s a contrast between the real people and the wrestling in its landscape , not real and out of proportion .
In your letter you seem angry at our laziness about the portrait , and that pains me ; friends don’t get angry with each other (at a distance , words cannot be interpreted at their true value) .
Another thing . You turn
  the dagger in the wound when you do all you can to prove to me that I must come to the south , given that I’m suffering on account of not being there at this moment . When you suggested that I go there as part of your partnership I categorically wrote you a last letter in the affirmative , happy at your brother’s offer . There’s no question for me of creating a studio in the north , since every day I hope for a sale that will allow me to leave here . The people who are feeding me here , the doctor who treated me , did it on credit and wouldn’t hold back a single
  painting , a single piece of clothing , and are faultless towards me — I can’t leave them without committing a bad deed that would trouble me enormously . If they were either rich or thieves , it would mean nothing to me . So I shall wait . On the other hand , if when the day came you were otherwise disposed , and you had to say to me , Too late . . . . . I’d prefer that you did it right away .
I’m fearful that your brother , who likes my talent , rates it too highly . If he found a collector or speculator who was tempted by low prices , let him do it . I’m a man of sacrifices , and
  I’d like him to understand that whatever he does , I’ll find it well done .
Young Bernard will shortly be taking several canvases of mine to Paris .
Laval expects to come and find me in the south towards the month of February . He’s found someone who’ll pay him 150 francs a month for a year .
It appears to me now , my dear Vincent , that you’re getting your sums wrong . I know the prices in the south ; aside from the restaurant , I undertake to keep the household going on 200 francs a month , with food for three . I have kept house , and I know how to get by .
  All the more so with four . As far as accommodation goes ; apart from yours , Laval and Bernard could have a small furnished room nearby . I like the way you picture your house and its arrangement , and my mouth is watering to see it .
Ah well! As far as possible I don’t want to think any more about the promised fruit . Waiting for better times , unless I’m released from this lousy existence , which , aside from work , weighs on me so horribly .
Cordially yours ,
P . Gauguin
