Letter|My dear Theo ,
Today I sent off that little crate , containing 1 other painting , Peasant cemetery , besides what I already told you .
I’ve left out some details — I wanted to say how this ruin shows that for centuries the peasants have been laid to rest there in the very fields that they grubbed up in life — I wanted to say how perfectly simply death and burial happen , coolly as the falling of an autumn leaf — no more than a bit of earth turned over — a little wooden cross . The fields around — where the grass of the churchyard ends , beyond the little wall , they make a last fine line against the horizon — like the horizon of a sea . And now this ruin says to me how a faith and religion mouldered away , although it was solidly founded — how , though , the life and death of the peasants is and will always be the same , springing up and withering regularly like the grass and the flowers that grow there in that churchyard . Victor Hugo , whom they’ve also just buried , said Religions pass , God remains .
 
I don’t know whether you’ll see anything in these two things — the cottage with the mossy roof reminded me of a wren’s nest . Anyway , you must just look at them .
Now I must take this opportunity of explaining to you again — which I found new , clear words for — why I wrote and write to you that I’m still far from sure whether your present view is your definite conviction . The firm of G&amp ; Cie isn’t a good school for getting to know paintings , let alone painters . I tell you this as my opinion — that one doesn’t even learn how to look independently there .
Who did they greatly honour? Paul Delaroche .
I don’t have to tell you how Delaroche was one of the people who really didn’t stand up to scrutiny — there’s simply no one left who takes his part .
Someone else who won’t stand up to scrutiny — even though he’s better — although he did make something very fine once or twice — who will also fail — that is — Gérôme .
 
His Prisoner , though , his Syrian shepherd are felt , and I think them as fine as anybody , and readily and willingly .
But by far the most often he’s a Delaroche II . Each of them , taking into account the context of their age , is of equal worth . What I’m now asserting is — that I consider it highly likely that the whole situation will bore you more by the year .
What I further assert is that one does both others and especially oneself too a disservice by being bored . In spite of many wise lessons , I’ve never seriously granted that being bored ‘for one’s own good’ can have its good , practical side . Now a MASS of people have reformed themselves at the age of about 30 and changed very considerably .
Just think calmly about this — I tell you that nothing of what I learnt and heard about art at G&amp ; Cie stood up to scrutiny . How if one reverses the generalities that count there as the conversation killers in judging art —
  namely praising the old or present-day Delaroche to the skies and discrediting the unorthodox — if , I say , one reverses certain maxims , then — one takes a breath of fresh air . In short — old chap — such curious turns in situations and affairs are possible — not only that — but even the rule . It’s funny , isn’t it — that , after all , I still doubt whether you’ll stay in the trade .
You don’t have to take any notice of this or reply to it — I say it to you just to express my idea frankly , not to start futile exchanges of words .
But it’s — an enchanted land — where one isn’t free .
Anyway — I’ll hear sometime whether you’ve received the little crate and whether you find anything in it .
Tomorrow I’m going to paint a thing in another village — also a cottage — in a smaller size . I found it last Sunday on a long trip I made in the company of a peasant — in order to get hold of a wren’s nest . We found 6 ; without doubt it was a place that Bodmer would have adored . And they were all nests from which the young had already flown , so that one could take them without too many pangs of conscience . It was so real ; I also have some other splendid nests . Regards , write soon , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
I’d like you to give both the paintings a varnish before you show them to Portier or Serret .
The peasant cemetery has sunk in particularly badly , because it was very different on the canvas at first and I scraped the first thing off completely . It was a total failure at first — then I gave it short shrift and started from the beginning , went and sat on another side and painted early in the morning instead of in the evening . Well , and the other — the one of the cottage — was originally a shepherd . The sheep were shorn last week ; I saw it — on a table in a barn .
I’m glad that this time I can show Portier something very different again . I’m busy drawing , by the way , so as to send a few full-length figures in a little while . But working on the cottages — perhaps you’ll say imitations of Michel , although they aren’t — and searching for subjects , I’ve found such splendid cottages that
  I now really must go bird’s nesting with a number of variations of these ‘people’s nests’ , which remind me so much of the nests of wrens — that’s to say , paint them .
Oh — one mustn’t doubt — anyone who paints the peasants nowadays and has his heart in his work , he wins — at least a part , and not the worst although it’s not the largest — of the public .
This doesn’t alter the fact that my end or second half of the month — can still work out remarkably meagre . But the same happens to the peasant lads too , and — they still have fun .
I wish you’d been here on Sunday when we went on that trip . I came back covered in mud because we had to spend a good half hour wading through a stream . But for me painting is now becoming as stimulating and enticing as hunting — it is a hunt , after all , for models , and beautiful places too . Regards again , and best wishes to you . It’s already late and I have to be at the place at 5 o’clock , so — adieu .
