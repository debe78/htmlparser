Letter|When the Lord’s Supper is next celebrated here I’ll attend it , you should do the same in The Hague , let us go as true participants in the Lord’s Supper .
And take this piece of rye bread too , and eat it , as I do , with our thoughts turned toward our Father’s house and to the things we heard and saw there .
And believe me
Your most loving and affectionate brother
Vincent
And pray: Lord , bless this food!
Herewith Ecce Homo , send me Mater Dolorosa . Adieu , old boy , a handshake in thought .
