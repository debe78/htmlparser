My dear Theo ,
I’m writing to you again now that I’ve walked around this village for a couple of days . What I find beautiful is everywhere here . That’s to say , there is peace here .
I find something else beautiful , too — that is the drama — but that , it’s everywhere , so there aren’t only Van Goyen effects here .
Yesterday I drew decaying oak roots , so-called bog trunks (being oak trees that have been buried under the peat for perhaps a century , over which new peat has formed — when the peat is dug out these bog trunks come to light) .
These roots lay in a pool in black mud . A few black ones lay in the water , in which they were reflected , a few bleached ones on the black plain . A little white track ran alongside it , behind it more peat , black as soot . Then a stormy sky overhead . That pool in the mud with those decaying roots , it was absolutely melancholy and dramatic , just like Ruisdael , just like Jules Dupré .
Here’s a little scratch from the peat fields .
There are often curious oppositions of Black and White here . For example , a canal with white sandy banks through a sooty black plain . You can see it above , too , small black figures against a white sky , and again gradations of black and white in the sand in the foreground .
I saw an effect exactly like Ruisdael’s Bleaching fields at Overveen: foreground a high road shadowed by clouds , then a low , bare meadow on which the light fell , with two houses in the distance (one with a slate-grey , one with a red roof) . Behind them a canal and stacks of peat , changing in size depending on the plane in which they stood — far away a small silhouette of a little row of huts and a small church tower . Small black figures laying the washing out to bleach , a single mast of a barge standing up between the peat stacks . Above , a grey sky with a lot of movement in it .
 
Well , I often think about Van Goyen on these misty mornings , the little houses are just like his . That really peaceful and naive look .
I believe I’ve found my country , you know . Coming events cast their shadows before , says an English proverb .
I just wanted to write and say that you do know , don’t you , that you must never think in melancholy hours that you’re without a friend? For I believe I can give you the assurance that you can trust me . Why am I saying this? — because I’ve since been thinking over what you wrote about America . And even so , I don’t think it’s a good plan , even if you do have the best relations there , that’s to say with Knoedler or anyone else .
Even if it’s only in melancholy moments that your thoughts turn to it , even if it isn’t a plan — I don’t believe it is — it’s still proof that you have your gloomy moments . Which I find remarkably understandable — even though I don’t know the circumstances , other than very generally , that it isn’t very pleasant in the firm . Wisselingh told me the story of the house in London , and all I say about it is that there’s most certainly a huge difference between the house of G&amp ; Cie in the old days (for instance , when Uncle Vincent was still there , and not even in his latter years) and now . I mean , in my view , in those days it was more a matter of personal energy and resoluteness . Now there are nullities (I don’t say mediocrities , not even in a bad sense , because that’s still much too good) like friend Bock , who , mark you , represent the house in London , and do so now that it’s organized on an infinitely lavish scale . Moreover , these aren’t isolated phenomena .
Now this must be very discouraging for people like you , everything much more discouraging than in earlier years . Personal passion for work , personal energy . Tersteeg has it , you have it , and at the same time despite that you have a position . But in the case of change , be aware that it could be that you get nothing out of it ,
  and may everywhere come up against the ‘triumph of mediocrity , of nullity , of absurdity’ .
Take Wisselingh , who had a strong character , very well , he keeps going even though he has nothing like the active life that Uncle Vincent had . Why not? — because it now comes down to different things and , if he was young now , say , Uncle Vincent would no longer be able to do now what he could do then , and you would be able to do now if now was then . So I say , what attraction does it hold nowadays , are people not bored? — as for my part I believe Wisselingh , for one , is hugely bored because he cannot act .
Furthermore , if you have personal energy , don’t wear it out , don’t let it get rusty , if things get miserable and one can’t count on anything , look for something simpler .
However , I’m so out of things , I really have such a complete lack of direct knowledge of it — I think the few words about London that I heard from Wisselingh are all that I’ve heard about the business in 1 1/2 years — that I may have got it all entirely wrong . Yet some things seem so extraordinary to me that I imagine the business in general as being out of joint , although I don’t know where or how things are disjointed the worst .
Now you’ll say , yes , but the painter’s affairs are much worse , less secure , and there too it could be that personal energy or personal passion for work couldn’t do everything , for example not provide food for someone at first . Very well , all granted , but suppose it was a question of the simplest needs , the business is no more critical for it , although it remains critical when , instead of the expensive city life , one seeks a place where it’s cheaper . Assuming I might have a bit of good fortune and we might succeed in finding a few friends for my work — then , yes , then I would be talking very differently .
 
Precisely because I have you to thank that I’ve been able to carry on thus far , I wanted to say to you that I don’t doubt for a moment that you would regard it as something wonderful if you had work for your hands , and even if initially it were to bring about the most impossible and conflicting relationships in your actual position in regard to life in general , nevertheless you would have a sense of ‘what does it matter to me’ to counter this , because of that view of the future . A future which , although it doesn’t depend entirely on making personal effort , would be more directly connected with it than things which aren’t manual work .
When you started you wouldn’t have to be alone , and that , I assure you , enormously shortens the time when nothing works . It’s really terrible that one sometimes has to search for a year for something that could be explained in a fortnight by someone who is further along . It comes down to personal effort , but the road is easier or harder depending on whether one is alone or not . And the worst thing is this absolutely having to know this or that , and if one asks for something the other turns his back on you . This is something beastly , but then that’s how it goes , and perhaps it goes with the manners . You’re then beaten , and it’s painful to know in advance that one will certainly go through a lot of mistakes before one finds out for oneself , which cause a waste of time and misery that could have been avoided .
One ends up not really asking anyone any more , and relying solely on oneself , but this ought to be organized rather differently . But then , there are so many things that ‘ought to be’ . Enough , I simply say if you ever change (even though there isn’t the least question of it now) , then become a painter .
And then start by spending the initial period with me , even though I myself don’t know as much as some other people , and although I myself still come up against many things . And I’ll speak much , much more confidently about this if I can get a little more certainty in my affairs this year . If C . M . comes , talk to him about things again . I wish above all that things would become a little easier for you through your relationship with him . Something that would also be very helpful to you is that you , in any event , come fresh from the art world , which I had already left long before when I started . For it’s necessary to feel clearly the rapports between nature and painted things in general . I’ve had to renew that in myself .
I hope to make something of the women on the heath in the scratch overleaf , and shall go back to the same field . Adieu , old chap , but all the same you mustn’t think about America , in my opinion .
With a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
And never think ‘I’m not an artist’ , because in so far as general gifts of energy and understanding are required , be assured that you have them .
As I said , I’m going to Hoogeveen on 12 October , but then I’m coming back here .
