Paris , 30 Sept . 1875 .
My dear Theo ,
Herewith the book about Michel that I promised you , also an etching after the Margaret by Scheffer and a lithograph after Corot , and a package of chocolate .
I do know that things aren’t easy for you at the moment , old chap , but remain steadfast and be brave ; ‘Not to dream , not to sigh’ is also necessary sometimes .
You know ‘that you are not alone but that the Father is with you’ . I shake your hand heartily in thought . Ever ,
Your loving brother
Vincent
Please keep the enclosed etching after Rembrandt , along with the photos of the Corot and the Jules Breton sent previously , until Pa and Ma are comfortably settled in Etten , and send them then , at the end of November for example .
