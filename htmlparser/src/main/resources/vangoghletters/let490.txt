Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m still very much under the impression of what has just happened — I just kept painting these two Sundays .
Herewith another scratch of a man’s head and one of a still life with honesty in the same style as the one you took with you . It’s rather larger , though — and the objects in the foreground are a tobacco pouch and a pipe of Pa’s . If you think you’d like it , of course you’re right welcome to have it .
Ma looks well , and writing many letters provides some distraction for the time being . But , of course , still very sad . Cor has just gone back to Helmond .
I don’t know whether you still remember that in January , when the snow was lying on the fields and the sun rose red in the mist , I wrote to you that I’d almost never started a year in a gloomier mood . It’s certain that there’ll be a whole lot more trouble for all of us .
Of course you’ll understand that it’s not for my convenience that I’ll go and live in the studio .
It will make things even more difficult for me .
But I’m convinced that it’s to their advantage for me to leave , particularly in view of Ma’s intention to take in a lodger this summer , if possible , who wanted to be in the country for his health — or should this not come about , then they’re still freer with regard to guests &amp ; c .
 
However , I still very much regret the incident with Anna that decided me in this respect . What she said to you changed nothing of what she reproached me for , and however absurd those reproaches were and her unfounded presumptions about things that are still in the future — she hasn’t told me she takes them back . Well — you understand how I simply shrug my shoulders at such things — and anyway , I increasingly let people think of me just exactly what they will , and say and do too , if need be .
But consequently I have no choice — with a beginning like that , one has to take steps to prevent all that sort of thing in the future .
So I’m absolutely decided .
It’s likely that Ma , Wil and Cor will go to Leiden next year . Then I’ll be the only one of us who’s still in Brabant .
And I think it by no means unlikely that I’ll stay here for the rest of my life , too . After all , I desire nothing other than to live deep in the country and to paint peasant life .
I feel that I can create a place for myself here , and so I’ll quietly keep my hand to my plough and cut my furrow . I believe that you thought differently about it , and that you would perhaps rather see me take another course as regards where I live .
But I sometimes think that you have more idea of what people can do in the city , yet on the other hand I feel more at home in the country .
 
All the same , it will still take me a great deal of effort before I imprint my paintings in people’s heads .
Meanwhile , I have no intention whatsoever of allowing myself to be discouraged .
I was thinking again of what I read about Delacroix — 17 of his paintings were rejected ; ‘dix-sept de refusés’ , he himself told his friends straight out .
I was thinking today that they really were almighty brave fellows , those pioneers .
But the battle has to be continued even now , and for my part I also want to fight for as much and as little as I’m worth . And so — Theo , I hope that we can continue on both sides what we’ve now started again . Awaiting or , rather , while I toil away on more important compositions , I’m sending you the studies as they come straight from the cottages . Of course people will say they’re not finished or they’re ugly &amp ; c . &amp ; c . , but — in my view — show them anyway . For my part , I have a firm belief that there are a few people who , ending up in and tied to the city , retain indelible impressions of the country , and continue to feel homesick for the fields and the peasants all their lives .
Art lovers like this are sometimes struck by sincerity , and not put off by what deters others .
I know how I used to walk round the city for hours , looking in the shop windows , to see some little view of the country somewhere , no matter what .
We’re now at the beginning of letting people see ; I believe absolutely and utterly that little by little we’ll find a few people for it . Circumstances compel us , and gradually we’ll also be able to show better things .
Now , at this moment , I’m very much preoccupied with paying off my paint bill , and moreover I need canvas , paint , brushes .
 
Since you’ve had to do exceptional things for the people at home because of Pa’s death , I’ve come up with the following idea .
Suppose that you don’t feel you’re in a position to give me the extra I received in spring and summer in other years , and which , by the way , I can’t do without .
Wouldn’t you think it fair in that case if , when settling affairs , I were to reserve for myself a sum of , say , 200 francs of my share , which I’ll otherwise right willingly let the youngsters have? And would be able to let them have altogether if you can help me .
By the way , I don’t see it as my letting them have my share — but rather that it’s because of you that they can keep my portion .
If I go to live in the studio , I’ll inevitably have to have a cupboard built , for instance , because at present I have nowhere at all to store things , and I’ll also improve the light .
To me , moving would be as bad as a fire — and anyway I think that we’ll stay on top of things with perseverance and effort .
I think I’ll start painting in watercolour regularly in the evenings — as soon as I’m living in the studio — it can’t really be done in the living room here at home . Until then , I’ll go on working from the model in the evenings too .
As to Anna — you mustn’t think that I’ll continue to take something like that amiss or hold a grudge about it — but only , it’s a shame that they think to do Ma a service with something like that — that’s a shame — and that’s stupid and unwise . As long as Ma and Wil are here , nothing unpleasant will happen between them and me ; I don’t think so . Only it’s certain that Ma simply cannot comprehend that painting is a faith and that it brings with it the duty to pay no heed to public opinion — and that in it one conquers by perseverance and not by giving in . And — ‘I can’t give you faith’ is also the case between Her Hon . and me — just as it was and remained with Pa too .
Anyway — I plan to make a start this week on that thing with the peasants around a dish of potatoes in the evening , or — perhaps I’ll make daylight of it , or both , or — ‘neither one’ — you’ll say . But should it succeed or should it fail , I’m going to start on the studies for the different figures . Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
