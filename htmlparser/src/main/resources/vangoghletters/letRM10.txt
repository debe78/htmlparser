Letter|Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart. Behold, Satan hath desired to have our soul, that he may sift us as wheat. And the end shall not be yet.
1 Cor XI:23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the remission of sins, this do ye, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, in remembrance of Me, and do shew the Lord‘s death till he come.
Luke XXII. And He came out, and went, as He was wont, to the mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone‘s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, saying, Father! if Thou be willing, remove this cup from Me! nevertheless not My will, but Thy will, be done. And there appeared an angel unto Him, strengthening Him. And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. And when He rose up from prayer, and was come to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.
Then Pilate questioned Him in many words, but He answered him nothing. And Pilate saith, Knowest Thou not that I have power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee? And Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, except it were given thee from Above.
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man.
