Letter|My dear ,
For a few days now I would have liked to reply to your kind letter , which I received while still in St-Rémy . Things weren’t working out there any more , and I was becoming rather iller through the treatment .
In Paris it was a great joy for me to see Theo again and to meet Jo and the one . Jo made an excellent impression upon me , she’s charming and very simple and good . Yes it really seems to me to be going as well as possible for the moment .
And as for myself , for the moment I still fear the noise and the bustle of Paris and I left immediately for the country – to an old village .
Here there are roofs of mossy thatch which are superb , and of which I’ll certainly do something .
 
Then I think that the to whom I’ve been recommended will absolutely let me be as if nothing were wrong .
In the last few days at St-Rémy I worked in a frenzy . Big bouquets of flowers , violet irises , big bouquets of roses . Landscapes .
It was odd to see all my canvases from the beginning again , from the time I left .
But I would very much have liked you to have seen the olive groves that I’ve brought with me now , with yellow , pink , blue skies , quite different , I think that these are canvases that haven’t yet been painted like this . Up to now the others always painted them in grey .
 
I was very pleased to see the exhibition at the Champ de Mars , where there are many things I like a lot .
