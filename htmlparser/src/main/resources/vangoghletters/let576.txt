Letter|Dear Sir,
If you come on my behalf you will find at Cluzelâ€™s, the framer in rue Fontaine, a painting that I have delivered for you (for our exchange). If you do not consider it suitable, let me know, and come and choose yourself. Forgive me if I do not come to collect your paintings myself, I am so rarely in your part of town. I shall collect them from 19 boulevard Montmartre if you will be so kind as to leave them there.
Yours,
Paul Gauguin
