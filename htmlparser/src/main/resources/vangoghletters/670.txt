Letter|My dear ,
If you’ll let me write to you in French , that will really make my letter easier for me .
You please me much more by being moved by sculpture than by painting — all the more so since Theo assures me that you also have a good eye for paintings . Naturally , that couldn’t yet be a settled taste , which will never waver , but intuition , instinct , is already a great deal , and precisely what everyone doesn’t always have .
But all the same , I’m very curious to know what effect the Luxembourg will have on you .
Is it true , as I think in moments when I’m in a good mood , that what is alive in art , and eternally alive , is first the painter and then the painting?
Well , what difference does that make — but if one sees people working it’s still something one doesn’t find under glass in museums .
Poor Miss Harriet in Guy de Maupassant , she was right , perhaps .
 
But was the painter wrong to go with the farm-girl? Perhaps not .
In life there’s always a fate that’s very annoying . And many painters die or go mad from despair , or become paralyzed in their production because nobody loves them personally .
Have you read Whitman’s American poems yet? Theo should have them , and I really urge you to read them , first because they’re really beautiful , and also , English people are talking about them a lot at the moment . He sees in the future , and even in the present , a world of health , of generous , frank carnal love — of friendship — of work , with the great starry firmament , something , in short , that one could only call God and eternity , put back in place above this world . They make you smile at first , they’re so candid , and then they make you think , for the same reason . The prayer of Christopher Columbus is very beautiful .
 
What do you say about Monticelli’s bouquet of flowers that’s at Theo’s , and about Prévost’s Spanish woman? There are two real paintings of the south .
I myself think about Monticelli a great deal down here . He was a strong man — a little , even very , cracked — dreaming of sunshine and love and gaiety , but always frustrated by poverty , a colourist’s extremely refined taste , a man of rare breeding , carrying on the best ancient traditions . He died in Marseille , rather sadly and probably after going through a real Gethsemane . Ah well , I myself am sure that I’ll carry him on here as if I were his son or his brother .
We were talking just now about a fate that seemed sad to us . But isn’t there another , delightful fate? And what is it to us if there is or isn’t a resurrection , when we see a living man rise up immediately in a dead man’s place? Taking up the same cause , carrying on the same work , living the same life , dying the same death .
 
When friend Gauguin’s here , and we go to Marseille , I firmly intend to walk there on the Canebière , dressed exactly like him , as I’ve seen his portrait , with an enormous yellow hat , a black velvet jacket , white trousers , yellow gloves and a reed cane and with a great southern air .
And I’ll find Marseillais who knew him when he was alive , and if you’ve read in Tartarin what fên de brût is . . . . . . . We’ll make quite a noise on that occasion . Monticelli is a painter who did the south all in yellow , all in orange , all in sulphur . Most painters , because they’re not colourists , properly speaking , don’t see these colours there , and declare that a painter who sees with other eyes than theirs is mad . (In the Luxembourg you’ll see Montenard that aren’t yellow , and I like them very much all the same . But it’s likely that Montenard would find what I do totally contemptible . ) All that is to be expected , of course . So I’ve already prepared especially a painting all in yellow of sunflowers (14 flowers) in a yellow vase and against a yellow background (it’s yet another one , in addition to the previous one with 12 flowers against a blue-green background) . And I expect one day to exhibit that one in Marseille . And you’ll see that there’ll be some Marseillais or other who will remember what Monticelli once said and did . Has Theo shown you the barbotine yet? It’s really fine . Enjoy yourself , I kiss you in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
