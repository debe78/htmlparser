Letter|The Hague , Thursday evening
My dear Theo ,
Accept my thanks for your letter and the enclosure . When I received your letter I was back in Etten , following Mauve’s advice , as I wrote to you . But now , as you see , I’m back in The Hague again .
At Christmas I had a rather violent argument with Pa , and feelings ran so high that Pa said it would be better if I left home . Well , it was said so decidedly that I actually left the same day .
Things actually came to a head because I didn’t go to church , and also said that if going to church was something forced and I had to go to church , I’d most certainly never go again , not even out of politeness , as I’ve been doing fairly regularly the whole time I’ve been in Etten . But oh , there’s actually much more to it , including the whole story of what happened this summer between me and K . V .
I was angrier than I ever remember being in my whole life , and I told Pa plainly that I found the whole system of that religion loathsome , and precisely because I dwelled on those things too much during a miserable time in my life I don’t want anything more to do with it , and have to guard against it as against something fatal .
Was I too angry , too violent? – so be it , but even supposing that to be the case , then at least now it’s over and done with .
I went back to M . and said , listen M . , I can’t stay in Etten and I have to go and live somewhere else , preferably here .
Well , M . said , stay here then . And so I’ve rented a studio here , namely a room and alcove which can be made suitable . Inexpensive enough , just outside town in Schenkweg , about 10 minutes from M .
 
Pa told me that if I needed money he would lend it to me if necessary , but now that’s impossible , I must remain completely independent of Pa . How? I don’t know yet , but M . is willing to help me if necessary , and you too , I hope and trust , and of course I’ll work and do my utmost to earn a little .
I’m here now , and the fact is there’s no turning back . At an inconvenient time , but what’s to be done?
I must have some simple furniture , and my expenses for drawing and painting materials aren’t getting any lower .
I also have to try and dress better . It’s a daring move , and a question of sink or swim . But some day I’d have set up house on my own , so what else can I do? Now things have gone faster than I expected .
As far as the relations between Pa and Ma and me are concerned , they can’t be put to rights so very quickly . The difference in our mentality and outlook on life is simply too great .
And although I spoke in anger , I said things that I also think when I’m in a calmer mood . So I don’t take back what I said , and anyway Pa has now heard it plainly . If I’d been calmer , I’d have said it in other , less extreme colours , but basically I’d have thought the same .
And I hope that in any case it will lead to something good . I must endure bad times and the waters will rise , possibly as high as the lips and possibly even higher , how can I know beforehand? But I’ll fight my fight and sell my life dearly and try to win and pull through .
 
I’ll be moving into the studio around 1 January . Regarding furniture , I’ll take the very simplest , a wooden table , a couple of chairs .
For a bed , I’d be content with a woollen blanket and the floor . But M . wants me to buy a bed and will lend me the money if necessary . When drawing up an account of the 100 francs , there turned out to be money left over , even though I made two journeys this summer , and once , the last time , for such a long time . It’s true that I ate and slept at home , but Pa himself said at the time that he could spare it .
You understand that I’m now extremely worried , and foresee much toil and tribulation . But still it’s a relief to me that I’ve gone so far that I can no longer go back , and that even though the path is difficult , my path is now clear enough .
It goes without saying that I’m asking you , Theo , if you can do it , to send me now and then what you can without going short yourself . And – in the circumstances , send it to me rather than giving it to others . Because if possible we shouldn’t get Mauve mixed up in this , as far as financial matters are concerned . It’s already of inestimable value that he helps me artistically in word and deed . He insists , however , that I buy a bed , for instance , and a couple of pieces of furniture , and says , I’ll lend it to you if necessary . Because according to him I must , no matter what , appear presentable as regards my clothing , and not try to scrimp and save .
 
I’ll write to you again soon . I don’t want to consider it a misfortune that it’s turned out this way , on the contrary , despite all the emotion I feel a certain calm .
There is safety in the midst of danger . What would life be if we didn’t dare to take things in hand?
I ran around everywhere to find that studio , both in the city and in Scheveningen .
Scheveningen is terribly expensive . This studio costs only 7 guilders a month , but the furniture makes it difficult . Still , if one has one’s own things , they won’t disappear , and one has surer ground beneath one’s feet .
The light comes from the south , more or less , but the window is large and high , and I have hopes that it will look nice after a time .
You can imagine how stimulated I feel . What will my work be like in a year? If only I could express what I feel – well , Mauve understands all this and wants to give me as many technical tips as he can – what fills my head and heart must be expressed in drawings or paintings .
Mauve himself is very busy with a large painting of a pink against the dunes being hauled by horses . I think it’s wonderful to be in The Hague , and I find no end of beautiful things and I must try and depict some of them .
Adieu , old chap , accept a handshake in thought and write soon , believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Many regards from M . and Jet .
I still have a bit of money , but how long will I be able to get by on it? I have to stay at the boarding-house until 1 January .
Just address your letters to the address A . Mauve . Uilebomen 198 , since I go there almost every day .
