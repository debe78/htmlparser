Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve written to you quite often lately , but it comes down to the same thing so much that I’m in fact dissatisfied that I don’t write to you more entertainingly . That will come again eventually — I think that once you’ve been to the studio again there will be livelier material . At least I hope so , and that will be the case if you’re in sympathy with what I’m working on and you haven’t yet seen .
This week in Paris Illustré I saw a fine reproduction of a drawing by Ulysse Butin , Launching the boat . Fishermen and women pushing a boat into the sea . I saw it just as I couldn’t help thinking a great deal about Butin and Legros while looking for something that’s a completely different subject from what they do , namely the potato grubbers on their knees and working with short forks , about whom I recently wrote to you that I was doing studies for them . I now have a sketch of them on the easel with 4 figures , 3 men and 1 woman . I wanted to have something broad and bold in silhouette and delineation in it . I’m searching for that more and more . I still remember how the first painting by Butin I saw (one of his later ones) made a strong impression on me . It was the one he later etched himself , called The pier I believe , women looking out for ships that are due to come in on a stormy evening . That was the first thing of his that I saw , and since then the one in the Luxembourg and several others .
 
I find him very honest and thorough , and believe that precisely when he appears to have dashed something off quickly he remains no less sound and correct in his drawing after all . He’s one of those men I don’t know personally and yet , when I see something by him , I can imagine how he did it .
Don’t you think the painting by Blommers at the Salon is beautiful (November)? I haven’t seen the painting but the reproduction , I think it’s just as if it were by Butin , with more passion and a greater dramatic element than B . normally has .
At the moment I have no fewer than 7 or 8 drawings measuring about 1 metre that I’m working on , so you can imagine that I’m up to my ears in work . But I’m very hopeful that I can make my hand more skilled through this period of toil . Thus , for instance , the reluctance I felt to work with charcoal is disappearing day by day . One of the reasons is that I’ve found a way of fixing the charcoal and then going over it with something else , such as printer’s ink .
 
Here’s a scratch of potato grubbers , but they’re slightly further apart in the drawing .
Now as I write to you I think of that evening — you may remember it even though it was years ago — when you and I spent an evening together with Mauve when he still lived near the Barracks , and were given a photograph after a drawing by him , a plough . Little did I think then that I would make drawings myself . Little did I also think then that difficulties would arise between Mauve and me .
I continue to be rather surprised that it hasn’t come right , all the more so because when you get down to it there’s virtually nothing about which there is a difference of view .
It’s now so long ago , in fact , that these days I’m beginning to regain my good humour as regards work , and confidence that it will be all right . I used to have that before , in spite of everything , but one can’t help being upset all the same , and feeling melancholy when such people disapprove or say that what one is doing is the wrong direction .
Will you write soon? Your letter will be most welcome again as always . Would you believe that a figure a foot high is not a bit easier to draw than a smaller one? On the contrary — everything is much more critical — and to get it as forceful in proportion as small figures at that size is sometimes very hard labour . Adieu , old chap , have good days and just do good business . With a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
