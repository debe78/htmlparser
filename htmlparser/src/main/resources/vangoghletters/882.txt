Mr Vincent
I am replying to your two letters , if we have delayed so long it is that my has been ill , he had a little accident , he had some friends , as chance had it they were present at the arrival of the bullocks , and the bullock butted him in the ribs , he could not walk , it gave him great pain , as for me I am much better , but I am still very tired , I cannot do anything . On Saturday he will send what you ask of us .
  He is much better , he can start to work in a few days , we would really have wanted to see you before leaving , we really regretted that you did not come here to Arles .
You have compliments from all the neighbours . Mrs Bressy says they will go and see you for a day or two in Paris .
Nothing else for the moment , give us news of yourself sometimes , you will give us great pleasure , we shall not remain so long in giving you a reply .
 
I shall end , my joins with me in shaking your hand in our hearts and in friendship .
Mrs Ginoux
On Saturday he will send you your things to your address which you sent us .
