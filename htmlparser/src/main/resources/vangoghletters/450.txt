Letter|My dear Theo ,
I think I already told you in my last letter that I also wanted to start a large male figure as well as that woman spinning . I now send you a little scratch of it herewith . Perhaps you remember two studies of the same corner , which I already had in the studio when you were here .
I read Les maîtres d’autrefois by Fromentin with great pleasure . And in different places in that book I again found the same questions dealt with that have preoccupied me very much recently , and about which I actually think continually , specifically since , at the end of my time in The Hague , I indirectly heard things that Israëls had said about starting in a low register and making colours that are still relatively dark appear light . In short , expressing light through opposition with dark . I already know what you say about ‘too black’ , but at the same time I’m still not completely persuaded that , to mention just one thing , a grey sky always HAS to be painted in the local tone . Which Mauve does ; but Ruisdael doesn’t do it , Dupré doesn’t do it . Corot and Daubigny???
Well , as it is with the landscape , so it is with the figure too — I mean , Israëls paints a white wall quite differently from Regnault or Fortuny .
  And consequently the figure looks quite different against it .
When I hear you talk about a lot of new names , it’s not always possible for me to understand when I’ve seen absolutely nothing by them . And from what you said about ‘Impressionism’ , I’ve grasped that it’s something different from what I thought it was , but it’s still not entirely clear to me what one should understand by it .
But for my part , I find so tremendously much in Israëls , for instance , that I’m not particularly curious about or eager for something different or newer .
Fromentin says of Ruisdael that people nowadays are much more advanced in technique than he was . They’re also more advanced than Cabat — who’s sometimes very like R . because of his dignified simplicity , for instance in the painting in the Luxembourg . But does this mean that what R . , what Cabat said has become untrue or superfluous? No . The same with Israëls , too — with Degroux , too (Degroux was very simple) .
If one says what one says clearly , though , this isn’t enough , strictly speaking .
And saying it with more charm might make it more pleasant to hear (which I don’t disparage , however) , but it doesn’t make what is true very much more beautiful , since the truth is beautiful in itself .

[Paint sample 1 , framed]
This is the very highest note in the study of the little old man , which expresses the snowy white of his skein of yarn in the light . That same white is much darker still in the shadow .

The measurement of the subject overleaf is about 105 x 95 cm , and that of the woman spinning 100 x 75 . They’re painted in a tone of bistre and bitumen which , it seems to me , lends itself to expressing the WARM chiaroscuro of an airless , dusty interior . Artz would certainly think it too dirty .
It has bothered me FOR A LONG TIME , Theo , that some of the painters nowadays are taking from us the bistre and the bitumen with which , after all , so many magnificent things were painted , which — properly used , make the coloration lush and tender and generous , and at the same time so dignified . And have such highly remarkable and individual qualities .
At the same time , though , they require that one take the trouble to learn to use them , for one has to deal with them differently from the ordinary types of paint , and I consider it perfectly possible that many people are frightened off by the experiments that one has to do first , and that naturally don’t succeed on the first day that one starts to use them . It’s now something like a year ago since I started using them , specifically for interiors , but at first they really disappointed me , and yet I always remembered the beautiful things I’d seen in them .
 
You have a better opportunity than I do to hear about books on art . If you come across good works by people like , say , the book by Fromentin on the Dutch painters , or if you remember any from the past , be aware that I’d very much like you to buy a few sometime , provided they deal with technique — and deduct it from what you usually send . I do intend to learn the theory — I don’t regard it as useless at all , and believe that often what one feels or suspects instinctively leads to certainty and clarity if , in one’s search , one has some guide in truly practical words . Even if there’s just one or a very few things of that nature in a book , it’s sometimes worthwhile not just to read it but actually to buy it , particularly nowadays .
And in the days of Thoré and Blanc there were people who wrote things that are now , unfortunately , already beginning to pass into oblivion .
 
To mention just one thing . Do you know what an unbroken tone and what a broken tone is? You can certainly see it in a painting , but do you also know how to explain what you see? What they mean by broken?
One should know this sort of thing , theoretically too , be it as a practitioner when painting or as an expert talking about colour .
Most people understand what they want to by it , and yet these words , for instance , have a VERY SPECIFIC meaning .
The laws of colour are inexpressibly splendid precisely because they are not coincidences . Just as people nowadays no longer believe in random miracles , in a God who jumps capriciously and despotically from one thing to another , but are beginning to gain more respect and admiration for and belief in nature , just so and for the same reasons I believe that people should — I don’t say ignore — but thoroughly scrutinize , verify and — — very substantially alter the old-fashioned ideas of innate genius , inspiration &amp ; c . in art .
 
I don’t deny the existence of genius , though , nor even its innate nature . But I do deny the inferences of it , that theory and training are always useless by the very nature of the thing .
I hope , or rather , I’ll try to do the same thing that I’ve now done in the little woman spinning and the old man winding yarn much better later on . Yet in these two studies from life I’ve been a bit more myself than I’ve succeeded in being in most other studies till now (barring a few of my drawings) .
As to black — as it happened I didn’t use it in these studies , since I needed a few stronger effects than black , among other things — — and indigo with terra sienna , Prussian blue with burnt sienna actually produce much deeper tones even than pure black . What I sometimes think when I hear people saying ‘there is no black in nature’ is — there doesn’t have to be any black in paint either .
Don’t , whatever you do , get the mistaken idea that the colourists don’t use black , because it goes without saying that as soon as an element of blue , red or yellow is added to black , it becomes a grey , that is a dark red , yellow or blue grey .
 
Among other things I thought what C . Blanc says in Les artistes de mon temps about Velázquez’s technique was very interesting — that his shadows and half-tones usually consist of colourless cool greys of which black and a bit of white are the chief components — in which neutral , colourless parts the least little dash or hint of red , say , is immediately apparent .
Well — regards , do write soon when you have something to write . It does surprise me rather that you don’t feel as much for Jules Dupré as I wish you did .
I believe so firmly that if I were again to see what I’ve seen by him before , far from finding it less beautiful I would find it even more beautiful than I already did instinctively . Dupré is perhaps even more of a colourist than Corot and Daubigny , although they both are too , and Daubigny really is very daring in colours . But with Dupré there’s something of a magnificent symphony in the colour , carried through , intended , manly . I imagine Beethoven must be something like that . This symphony is surprisingly CALCULATED and yet simple and infinitely deep , like nature itself . That’s what I think about it — about Dupré .
Well — adieu , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
