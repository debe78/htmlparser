Letter|My dear Theo ,
Even though I wrote to you only a short while ago , this time I have something more to say to you .
Namely that a change has come about in my drawing , both in my manner of doing it and in the result .
Prompted as well by a thing or two that Mauve said to me , I’ve started working again from a live model . I’ve been able to get various people here to do it , fortunately , one being Piet Kaufmann the labourer .
The careful study , the constant and repeated drawing of Bargue’s Exercices au fusain has given me more insight into figure drawing . I’ve learned to measure and to see and to attempt the broad outlines &amp ; c . So that what used to seem to me to be desperately impossible is now gradually becoming possible , thank God . I’ve drawn a peasant with a spade no fewer than 5 times , ‘a digger’ in fact , in all kinds of poses , twice a sower , twice a girl with a broom . Also a woman with a white cap who’s peeling potatoes , and a shepherd leaning on his crook , and finally an old , sick peasant sitting on a chair by the fireplace with his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees .
And it won’t stop there , of course , once a couple of sheep have crossed the bridge the whole flock follows .
Diggers , sowers , ploughers , men and women I must now draw constantly . Examine and draw everything that’s part of a peasant’s life . Just as many others have done and are doing . I’m no longer so powerless in the face of nature as I used to be .
 
I brought Conté in wood (and pencils as well) from The Hague , and am now working a lot with it .
I’m also starting to work with the brush and the stump . With a little sepia or indian ink , and now and then with a bit of colour .
It’s quite certain that the drawings I’ve been making lately don’t much resemble anything I’ve made up till now .
The size of the figures is more or less that of one of the Exercices au fusain .
As regards landscape , I maintain that that should by no means have to suffer on account of it . On the contrary , it will gain by it . Herewith a couple of little sketches to give you an idea of them .
Of course I have to pay the people who pose . Not very much , but because it’s an everyday occurrence it will be one more expense as long as I fail to sell any drawings .
But because it’s only rarely that a figure is a total failure , it seems to me that the cost of models will be completely recouped fairly soon already .
For there’s also something to be earned in this day and age for someone who has learned to seize a figure and hold on to it until it stands firmly on the paper . I needn’t tell you that I’m only sending you these sketches to give you an idea of the pose . I scribbled them today quickly and see that the proportions leave much to be desired , certainly more so than in the actual drawings at any rate . I’ve had a good letter from Rappard who seems to be hard at work , he sent me some very nice sketches of landscapes . I’d really like him to come here again for a few days .
 
[sketch A]
This is a field or stubble field which is being ploughed and sown , I have a rather large sketch of it with a storm brewing .
[sketch B]
The other two sketches are poses of diggers . I hope to make several more of these .
[sketch C]
 
[sketch D]
 
The other sower has a basket .
It would give me tremendous pleasure to have a woman pose with a seed basket in order to find that figure that I showed you last spring and which you see in the foreground of the first sketch .
[sketch E]
In short , ‘the factory is in full swing’ , as Mauve says .
Remember that Ingres paper , if you will , of the colour of unbleached linen , the stronger kind if possible . In any case , write to me soon if you can , and accept a handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
