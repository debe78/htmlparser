Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
I just received your letter and croquis of your painting . It’s certainly a good subject , and I have nothing against the composition as regards balance .
May I say one thing — which I would not say if the painting was finished and consequently difficult to alter — which I do say since certain changes that do not concern the lines could be made to advantage? Look — the figure in the middle of the painting — the woman with the rake . Good in its place , but — raking the yard is an action that’s too much of a minor detail for a central figure to be carrying out , it seems to me . For this reason , for my part I would rather see the figure in the middle — in the foreground — carrying bricks (that being a very expressive and characteristic action here , accounted for by the whole thing) . I would rather put the rake in the hands of the figure in the middle ground (who is now carrying bricks (and occupies a secondary place in the composition)) .
Is this possible? In respect to the progress of the work? If not — just think if you will about the question — for it seems to me that it’s not unimportant — and comments could be made about it . The fact that the figure is upright there is good , but — without altering the lines — isn’t there a more interesting action you could think of? Don’t hold this against me , please — I don’t think it can do any harm to put forward things like this for consideration when a painting is being planned . I don’t think that this is forcibly pressing my ideas on you . Making the actions expressive is an extremely important matter , in my view , particularly if the painting is to be a large format . I know this is asking a lot — I know that the lines and the balance of the lines may lay down the law here .
 
But those lines may well remain beautiful and tranquil . Anyway — I believe that it may be that I’m not wrong in this respect — and it’s about your central figure — so I didn’t dare not say what my impression was . If it’s not asking too much , I’d like to suggest having one of the brick-carriers stoop and put down the bricks , so that they aren’t both doing the same . But it comes to the same thing , since there would then be two stooping figures . And after all , that doesn’t matter so much . But the first comment is actually what I feel above all .
As regards my work , the thing with those potato eaters that you saw the lithograph of is a subject that I tried to paint , carried away by the singular lighting of the dingy cottage . It’s in such a low spectrum that the light colours , smeared on white paper , say , would look like ink blots — they appear as lights on the canvas because of the strong forces that are opposed to them , for instance Prussian blue laid on just as it is , without mixing . My own criticism is that while paying attention to this I lost sight of the shape of the torsos . Heads and hands were done with great care , though , and — since these were the most important and the rest almost entirely dark (so really quite different in effect from the lithograph) , it may perhaps be more excusable of me than you think to have painted it as I did . And besides , the drawing in the actual painting is also different from either the rough sketch that I still have of it and which I made in the cottage in the evening by the light of a small lamp , or the lithograph .
 
I also wanted to tell you that since you were here I’ve painted a fairly large number of heads , and drawn quite a lot of figures of peasants , diggers , weeders , reapers . That in all this , either directly or indirectly , the great question occupied me — colour .
I mean the breaking of the colours , red with green , blue with orange , yellow with violet . Always how the complementary colours go together , their influence on each other . Of which nature is as full as of light and shade .
Another question — which I’m engrossed in every day — is precisely the one that you — I think unjustly — asserted that I neglect: the rendering of the modelling of the form , its main lines and masses , where one thinks of outline in the last place , not the first . See herewith a couple of croquis of small compositions — both of which I’ve painted . I’ve mostly been working in a fairly small format lately .
As I continue to focus my attention specifically on the peasants , the landscape is something that I’m involved with every single day .
I had just painted some cottages when Wenckebach came to see me .
I have literally nothing new as regards woodcuts , apart from — 4 large compositions by Lhermitte .
To me , that man is MILLET II in the full sense of the word ; I idolize his work as I do that of Millet himself . I think his genius on a par with that of Millet I .
 
My brother was here just recently , he told me several things about what’s going on in Paris that I find very encouraging . The success of the Eugène Delacroix exhibition . Then I was interested in what he told me about Raffaëlli , a figure painter , and Claude Monet , a colourist landscape painter .
For the rest , you’ll notice it for yourself — it’s not so much a golden as an iron age for painters — I mean it’s not exactly easy to even stay alive . At least as far as I’m concerned , it’s sheer destitution — only with all that , my courage and perhaps my powers , too , are greater rather than less than before . Don’t think you’re the only one who thinks or thought — as you will — he had to criticize me to the point of total destruction — on the contrary , it’s pretty much the only thing I’ve experienced so far . Precisely because you aren’t or weren’t the only one who speaks solely like this , your criticism is related to other criticism , which , for my part , I counter with a conviction of having a raison d’être for my endeavours — and — will continue to counter more and more .
The reason why I — although I didn’t insist on my way but let you have your way — the reason why I started by asking you to consider — complete retraction of your criticism , wasn’t that I despotically wanted to bend or break your opinions . That wasn’t my intention in the least , although that’s how you took it .
 
Here are details that are perfectly correct . I let fly at you about drawing plaster models , and I even have to confess frankly that I’d be capable of doing it again .
And about other questions — I can’t always sit quietly by ; it sometimes seems to me as if people are physically touching me , so bound to the question do I sometimes feel and so much is my conviction sometimes a part of myself .
It’s true that there are definitely faults in the lithograph and in much other work , too . But in other work I prove too clearly what I’m seeking for people to be justified or acting in good faith when they do other than judge it as a whole and more broadly — taking into account the aim and endeavour — namely to paint peasants in their setting — the peasant at home .
Now you call that totality of my work extremely weak , and demonstrate at great length that the faults outnumber the qualities .
Thus about my work , thus about my person .
  Well now , I do not accept that , definitely not .
The work in question , painting the peasants , is such laborious work that the extremely weak would never even embark on it . And I have at least embarked on it and have laid certain foundations , which isn’t exactly the easiest part of the job! And I’ve grasped some solid and useful things in drawing and in painting , more firmly than you think , my dear friend . But I keep on making what I can’t do yet in order to learn to be able to do it .
But it bores me and you to write about this . I’ll end by saying the labour is hard , and it would be wise for the fellows who paint peasants and the common people to join hands as much as is possible instead of quarrelling . Unity is strength , and what we should be fighting is not one another but those fellows who , even now in this period , stand in the way of the progress of the ideas for which Millet and others of a previous generation fought and were pioneers . Nothing is more obstructive than this fatal quarrelling among ourselves .
And as for you and me , let this be at an end , for our objective is the same .
 
But my reason was precisely that your endeavour and mine , although they’re not the same , nonetheless run parallel rather than being diametrically opposed . And while as a direction and in principle there are points of agreement enough and , I think , will continue to be , it occurred to me that your criticism as a whole was inconsistent , in its application to me , with the character of your own work .
We have in common with each other that we seek our subjects in the heart of the people , and then we have in common a need — either as an objective or as a means — to take our studies from reality . And that — is having a lot in common with each other . And at bottom , as to whether we’re opposed in regard to either drawing technique or painting technique , I for my part am not convinced of that . You’re ahead of me in many things , I don’t deny it , but I still believe you went too far .
But be that as it may — what I consider desirable is that because if we want to and try to we could perhaps be of use and give support to each other — and because unity is strength — we must remain friends .
 
As regards technique — I’m still searching for many things and with me it’s the case that , although I find some of them , there remain infinitely many that I lack . But — all the same , I know why I work as I work — and base my search on solid ground .
I said to Wenckebach recently that I didn’t know a painter who had as many faults as I have — but that for all that it did not convince me that I’m radically wrong .
With me it’s sometimes a matter of: two negatives making a positive . Take whichever study or drawing of mine you like , even the one I’d point out to you myself with relative equanimity . And — there’ll be mistakes both in the drawing and in the colour or tone that a realist wouldn’t readily make . Certain inaccuracies of which I’m convinced myself , which if need be I myself will sometimes point out more severely than other people . Inaccuracies sometimes , or imperfections .
And yet I believe that — even if I keep producing work in which people , if they want to look at it precisely from that angle and with that aim , can find faults — it will have a certain life of its own and raison d’être that will overwhelm those faults — in the eyes of those who appreciate character and mulling things over in their minds .
  And with all my faults , people won’t find it as easy to overwhelm me as they think . I know too well what aim I have in view , I’m too absolutely and utterly convinced that I am , after all , on the right path — when I want to paint what I feel and feel what I paint — to worry too much about what people say of me .
All the same , it sometimes makes life very difficult for me and — I consider it very possible that some people will later regret either the things they said about me , or the opposition or indifference with which they plagued me . What I do in response is withdraw so much that I literally don’t see anybody other than — the peasants — with whom I’m directly concerned in order to paint them .
And this will remain my system , and it may even very well be that before long I’ll give up my studio and go and live in a cottage , so that I no longer hear or see anything of those who call themselves civilized people .
When I say to you that I want to remain friends , and mean it , though , it’s because I see in you an endeavour that I regard very highly . You go deep into the people and you have the strength of will to carry it through . When I say we could perhaps be of use and give support to each other — then I say it
  because , in the event that you don’t submit to conventions , you will probably , as you become better known , possibly make even bolder things , and then it could come to a positive clash between paintings of one school and another . And in such circumstances it could be a good thing for various painters to act in unison . From another angle — I don’t think it’s useless to share ideas and see one another’s work .
Here’s a third little scratch of a study I did yesterday .
Regards — I feel obliged to offer the comment about the action of the woman in the middle of your composition for your consideration ; for the rest I think the composition very sensible and the whole design sympathetic . When you see Wenckebach , would you please give him my regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
You can see from my croquis that , for my part , I take a lot of trouble specifically to get action — being occupied — doing something — into my figures .
I think it’s good that one figure in your composition , at any rate , is already stooping — being in the process of working is perhaps something that a lot of vertical lines in the composition would make harder to express .
