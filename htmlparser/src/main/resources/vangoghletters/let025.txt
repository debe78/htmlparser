My dear Theo ,
Thanks for the information you got . We’re now staying a day longer and will arrive in London on Wednesday morning .
I gave you the photo in the Forbes catalogue here already , because I thought it would interest you , being the Scheldt and therefore Belgium . It’s of a painting by Cap . It’s not so very beautiful , but at least it’s original . I’ll write to you soon from London . I wish you well .
Vincent .
