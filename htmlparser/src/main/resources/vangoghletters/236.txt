Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
I gratefully enclose the 2 . 50 guilders you were good enough to lend me . I’ve had a reply to my drawings , but received even less for them than I expected , although my expectation was no more than 30 guilders for 7 items . I received 20 guilders with a sort of reprimand to boot: ‘did I imagine that such drawings had the least commercial value?’
You must admit that the times aren’t easy , and that such experiences (and there are so many worse things ; this is generous compared with other treatment) and , I say , that such experiences aren’t exactly very encouraging .
Art is jealous and demands all our time , all our strength , and then , when you give it all that , you’re made out to be a sort of impractical type and I don’t know what else — that leaves a bitter taste .
Well , we must keep hacking our way through .
 
I replied that I didn’t pretend to be well-informed as to the commercial value of things , that now that , as a dealer , told me that they were of no commercial value , I had no desire to contradict or question that , that for my part I attached more importance to the artistic than to the commercial value , and would rather immerse myself in nature than calculate prices . And that when I talked to him about the price and didn’t give him the things for nothing , that was because I , like everyone else , had my basic needs for food , accommodation , &amp ; c . , and saw it as a duty to ensure that I took care of these relatively minor matters . But that I didn’t want to force my work on His Hon . against his will , and was prepared to send him new drawings if he wanted , but was also prepared to accept the loss of his custom . I have little doubt , though , that my course of action will be viewed as ungrateful , rude and impertinent .
And I’ll be accused as follows , when it suits the purpose: ‘With your pretensions and obstinacy you behaved so ungratefully towards your in Amsterdam , who had your best interests at heart and was so kind to you and helped you so much , that it’s your own fault’ &amp ; c . &amp ; c . &amp ; c .
My dear friend Rappard , I really don’t know whether to laugh or weep at this sort of thing . I find it so typical .
  Of course , the rich dealers are the good , honest , genuine , loyal , sensitive characters , and we poor devils who sit there drawing , whether out of doors , on the street , or in the studio , sometimes in the early morning , sometimes deep at night , sometimes in the heat of the sun , sometimes in the snow , we’re the people without sensitivity , with no understanding of practical matters , without ‘manners’ above all . Fine by me!
That of mine in Amsterdam also informed me with considerable aplomb that Degroux was in fact a bad person . You will understand how much this has changed my opinion about père Degroux . All I said to him , to which as yet he has given me no reply , the noble dealer , what I said to him was: ‘It seems to me much less a matter of earning than of deserving . ’
Anyway — I mention it to you as a way of opening the safety valve on the machine , otherwise I might remain bitter about the business , and my dearest wish is not to think about it any more and to forget it . But these people begin so kindly and manage to be so winning at first that you’re all the more amazed when you eventually see their true colours .
Adieu , thanks again , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
