Letter|Dear Mr Aurier ,
Thank you very much for your article in the Mercure de France , which greatly surprised me . I like it very much as a work of art in itself , I feel that you create colours with your words ; anyway I rediscover my canvases in your article , but better than they really are — richer , more significant . However , I feel ill at ease when I reflect that what you say should be applied to others rather than to me . For example , to Monticelli above all . Speaking of ‘he is – as far as I know – the only painter who perceives the coloration of things with such intensity , with such a metallic , gem-like quality’ – if you will please go and see a particular bouquet by Monticelli at my brother’s place – bouquet in white , forget-me-not blue and orange – then you will feel what I mean . But for a long time the best , the most astonishing Monticellis , have been in Scotland , in England . In a museum in the north however – the one in Lille I think , there must still be a marvel by him , far richer and certainly no less French than Watteau’s Departure for Cythera . At present Mr Lauzet is in the process of reproducing around thirty Monticellis . Here you have it , as far as I know there is no colourist who comes so straight and directly from Delacroix ; and yet it is likely , in my opinion , that Monticelli only had Delacroix’s colour theories at second hand ; in particular he had them from Diaz and Ziem . It seems to me that his , Monticelli’s , artistic temperament is exactly that of the author of the Decameron – Boccaccio – a melancholy man , an unhappy , rather resigned man , seeing high society’s party pass by , the lovers of his day , painting them , analyzing them , he – the outcast . Oh! He does not imitate Boccaccio any more than Henri Leys imitated the primitives . Well , this was to say that things seem to have strayed onto my name that you would do better to say of Monticelli , to whom I owe a great deal . Next I owe a great deal to Paul Gauguin , with whom I worked for a few months in Arles , and whom , besides , I already knew in Paris .
Gauguin , that curious artist , that stranger whose bearing and gaze vaguely recall Rembrandt’s Portrait of a man in the La Caze gallery , that friend who likes to make one feel that a good painting should be the equivalent of a good deed , not that he says so , but anyway it is difficult to spend time with him without thinking of a certain moral responsibility . A few days before we parted , when illness forced me to enter an asylum , I tried to paint ‘his empty place’ .
It is a study of his armchair of dark , red-brown wood , the seat of greenish straw , and in the absent person’s place a lighted candlestick and some modern novels . If you have the opportunity , as a memento of him , please go and look a little at this study again , which is entirely in broken tones of green and red . You may perhaps then realize that your article would have been more accurate and – it would seem to me – thus more powerful – if in dealing with the question of the future ‘painting of the tropics’ and the question of colour , you had done justice to Gauguin and Monticelli before talking about me . For the share that falls or will fall to me will remain , I assure you , very secondary .
And then , I would also have something else to ask of you . Supposing that the two canvases of sunflowers that are presently at the Vingtistes have certain qualities of colour , and then also that they express an idea symbolizing ‘gratitude’ . Is this any different from so many paintings of flowers that are more skilfully painted and which people do not yet sufficiently appreciate , père Quost’s Hollyhocks , Yellow Irises? The magnificent bouquets of peonies which Jeannin produces in abundance? You see , it seems to me so difficult to separate Impressionism from
  other things , I cannot see the point of so much sectarian thinking as we have seen these last few years , but I fear its absurdity .
And , in closing , I declare that I do not understand that you spoke of Meissonier’s infamies . It is perhaps from that excellent fellow Mauve that I have inherited a boundless admiration for Meissonier ; Mauve was endless in his praise for Troyon and Meissonier – a strange combination .
This is to draw your attention to how much people abroad admire , without attaching the slightest importance to what unfortunately so often divides artists in France . What Mauve often repeated was something like this , ‘if you want to do colour you must also know how to draw a fireside or an interior like Meissonier’ .
I shall add a study of cypresses for you to the next consignment I send to my brother , if you will do me the pleasure of accepting it as a memento of your article . I am still working on it at the moment , wanting to put in a small figure . The cypress is so characteristic of the landscape of Provence , and you sensed it when saying: ‘even the colour black’ . Until now I have not been able to do them as I feel it ; in my case the emotions that take hold of me in the face of nature go as far as fainting , and then the result is a fortnight during which I am incapable of working . However , before leaving here , I am planning to return to the fray to attack the cypresses . The study I have intended for you depicts a group of them in the corner of a wheatfield on a summer’s day when the mistral is blowing . It is therefore the note of a certain blackness enveloped in blue moving in great circulating currents of air , and the vermilion of the poppies contrasts with the black note .
You will see that this constitutes more or less the combination of tones of those pretty Scottish checked cloths: green , blue , red , yellow , black , which once appeared so charming to you as they did to me , and which alas one scarcely sees any more these days .
In the meantime , dear sir , please accept my grateful thanks for your article . If I were to come to Paris in the spring I shall certainly not fail to come and thank you in person .
Vincent van Gogh
When the study I send you is dry right through , also in the impasto , which will not be the case for a year – I should think you would do well to give it a good coat of varnish . And between times it should be washed several times with plenty of water to get out the oil completely . This study is painted in full Prussian blue , that colour about which people say so many bad things and which nevertheless Delacroix used so much . I think that once the Prussian blue tones are really dry , by varnishing you will obtain the dark , the very dark tones needed to bring out the different dark greens .
I do not quite know how this study should be framed , but as I really want it to make one think of those dear Scottish fabrics , I have noticed that a very simple flat frame , bright orange lead , creates the desired effect with the blues of the background and the dark greens of the trees . Without this there would perhaps not be enough red in the canvas , and the upper part would appear a little cold .
