Letter|My dear Theo ,
I had wanted to inform you earlier of the safe receipt of your letter and the 150 francs enclosed . I’ve also received the September Lhermitte — it’s splendid .
You write about the Poussin in the Louvre — I like Poussin very much .
But what a long time ago it is — too long — since I saw those paintings . As to that — I need to see paintings , and I must do something about it . Precisely because I very much hope to go finding people for my own work , I think it will be good for me to go on a trip every now and then .
Longing most of all for Rembrandt and Frans Hals , one day this week I’m going to the museum in Amsterdam with a of mine in Eindhoven whose studies I once showed you . If I can acquire connections for my own work , I won’t fail to do so — and I firmly believe that with perseverance I’ll win .
 
As for the work , I’ve been painting a lot of still lifes lately , as I already wrote , and I like it enormously . I’ll send you some . I know that they’re difficult to sell — but it’s devilish useful and I’ll go on doing a lot to them in the winter .
You’ll get a large still life of potatoes — where I’ve tried to get body into it — I mean express the material . Such that they become lumps that have weight and are solid , which you’d feel if they were thrown at you , for instance .
Anyway , you’ll just have to see .
That dispute I had with the — I haven’t had much more bother with it . There’ll always be God-fearing natives in the village who’ll still believe me capable of it , though , because it’s certain that the priest would love to pin the blame for that business on me . Since I’m not to blame , though , the rumours from that quarter leave me
  completely cold . As long as they don’t get in the way of my painting I don’t take any notice of them whatsoever . I’ve remained on good terms with the peasants to whom it happened and where I went to paint a lot , and am just as welcome in their home as before .
I’m now working on still lifes of my birds’ nests , and I’ve finished 4 of them . I think that some people who know nature well might like them because of the colours of the moss , dry leaves and grasses , clay &amp ; c .
I’ll write to you again at the end of this week , when I’m back from the little trip to Amsterdam .
Since I have to pay my rent again next month , I can hardly afford the expense . But it’s essential . So more soon .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
I’m sure my work will benefit in the long run if I see more paintings — because when I see a painting I can work out what it’s done with .
 
As for Poussin — he’s a painter who thinks and makes one think about everything — in whose paintings all reality is at the same time symbolic . In the work of Millet , of Lhermitte , all reality is also symbolic at the same time .
They’re something other than what people call realists .

In the winter , when I have more time for it , I’ll make several drawings of this sort of thing . I feel for the brood and the nests — particularly those human nests , those cottages on the heath and their inhabitants .
