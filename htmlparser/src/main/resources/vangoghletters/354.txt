Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Was writing a letter to you when the post brought your most welcome letter just a moment ago . I’m pleased you’ve made progress with your drawing , I didn’t doubt that you would , by the way , for you’d made a manly start .
Well , let me begin by saying that I think what you say about the English draughtsmen is entirely correct and entirely right . I saw it in your work , exactly what you say . Well , I take the same view .
On the bold outlines in particular .
Take the etching by Millet , The diggers , take an engraving by Albrecht Dürer , take above all the large woodcut by Millet himself , The shepherdess , and then one sees fully what can be expressed by such an outline .
And as you say , one then has the feeling ‘that’s how I’d always have wanted to do it if I’d always gone my own way’ &amp ; c . That’s well said , old chap , and spoken like a man .
Now , what I also find an example of singularly robust , forceful drawing is Leys’s paintings , particularly the series of decorations for his dining room . The walk in the snow , the skaters , the reception , the table , the servant . And Degroux has it as well and Daumier has it as well .
Israëls himself and sometimes , sometimes Mauve and Maris too , cannot resist forceful outline , but don’t do it like Leys or like Herkomer .
And when one hears them , they really don’t want to know , and talk most about tone and colour . Yet in some charcoal drawings Israëls used lines reminiscent of Millet . I for one declare to you frankly that , with all the love and respect I have for these masters , I find it a pity that they , especially Mauve and Maris , don’t point out what can be done with the outline more often when talking to others , and recommend drawing carefully and softly .
 
And so it is that these days watercolour is the order of the day and considered to be the most expressive medium , and in my view too little effort goes into Black and White , to the point even that there’s a certain antipathy to it . In watercolour there’s no black , so to speak , and that’s the basis for people talking about ‘those black things’ . All the same , there’s no need to spend the whole of this letter writing about that .
Wanted to inform you that at present I have 4 drawings on the easel . Peat diggers — Sand quarry — Dung-heap — Loading coal .
I even did the dung-heap twice ; the first became too worn to continue working on .
I didn’t dare work on them much with turpentine and printer’s ink , have used charcoal , lithographic crayon and autographic ink so far . Except in the sketch for the dung-heap that got too worn — I tackled that with them , with not unfavourable results . It became black , but still some of the freshness came back into it , and now I see possibilities for working in it again , whereas before the printer’s ink came on it I saw no possibility of that .
I’ve worked hard since I visited you , I hadn’t composed for so long and had done a great many studies , so once I began I went at it furiously .
  Several mornings I was already at work at 4 o’clock . I would like it immensely if you saw them sometime , for I can make no sense of what Van der Weele said about them , the only one to have seen them .
Van der Weele’s judgement was rather sympathetic , but he said of the Sand quarry that there were too many figures in it . The composition wasn’t simple . He said , look , draw that one little fellow with his wheelbarrow on a dyke in the evening set against the light sky , how beautiful that would be , for instance , and now it lacked cohesion .
Well , then I showed him the drawing by Caldecott , Brighton Highroad , and said , do you mean that it’s absolutely not permitted to put many figures in a composition and to make it highly complicated? Leaving aside my drawing , tell me what you think of this composition . Well , he said , I don’t find that beautiful either but , he added , I’m speaking personally and can only speak personally . And that’s not what I like or what I look at . Well , I thought that was rather well said , but you understand that I didn’t find in him that awareness of the question that I sought . But for the rest he’s a solid fellow , and I had some very pleasant excursions with him and he showed me some devilishly beautiful things .
It was also during a walk with him that I saw the sand quarry , but that time he hardly looked at it and I went back alone the next day . I drew the sand quarry with a lot of figures , because sometimes there really are a great many fellows toiling away in those sandpits , for example in the winter and the autumn they provide work there in the name of the city for those who have no work . And then it’s wonderfully pleasing there .
 
I’ve had several fine models of late . A superb grass-mower , a splendid country lad , exactly like one of Millet’s figures .
A fellow with a wheelbarrow — you may remember me drawing his head in Sunday clothes with a Sunday patch over his blind eye .
Now I have him in his everyday suit , and it’s perhaps hard to believe that it’s the same man who posed for the two figures .
These four big drawings are 1 metre by 1/2 metre .
I feel happy using a brown passe-partout with a very deep black inside edge . Then many blacks that would appear too black in a white passe-partout look grey and the whole remains clear .
By Jove , I wish you could see them , not because I myself think they are good , but I would like to hear your thoughts about them , even though I’m not yet satisfied with them . To my taste they aren’t yet figure drawings in the true sense of the term , although they are still figure drawings , but I wanted to express the outlines of actions and structure even more squarely and boldly .
What you write about feeling that you’re now on a road and not on byways or side roads seems to me absolutely right . Have a similar feeling myself , because this last year I’ve concentrated more on the figure than in the past .
Be assured , if you believe I have eyes to see , that there is certainly sentiment in your figures ; what you make is healthy and manly , do not doubt yourself in that respect and , precisely because you do not doubt , dash it on without hesitating .
The studies of heads for the blind fellows seem superb to me .
 
Wanted to tell you about a type of pencil by Faber that I’ve found . Here you see the thickness of the cross-section .
[sketch A]
They’re soft and better quality than the carpenter’s pencils , produce a marvellous black and are very agreeable to work with for large studies .
I used it to draw a woman sewing on grey papier sans fin and got an effect like lithographic crayon . These pencils are made of soft wood , dyed green on the outside , cost 20 cents apiece .
Before I forget — I wanted to borrow the issues of Harper’s Magazine you have to read the articles about Holland that Boughton and Abbey illustrated . I’ll send you a package with the old loose issues that I have with illustrations by Howard Pyle &amp ; c . so that you can look through them at your leisure . And shall add Erckmann-Chatrian , Histoire d’un paysan illustrated by Schuler , and enclose several illustrations by Green that you will remember I promised . If you still have duplicates , add them to the Harpers (at least if you can do without the latter for about a fortnight so that I can read them) , and Zola’s book about Manet if you’ve finished it .
I’m sorry that your health isn’t yet in order , but I think that what will cheer you up more than the baths or whatever it is they do there in Soden is to make solid progress with your drawings . I reckon you’ll be longing for your studio as soon as you’re out of it . I know that Mauve became terribly melancholy during a journey to a similar kind of factory , speaking with all due respect .
As you know , I’m very unbelieving in matters of this kind , and can sympathize with Bräsig in Reuter’s Gedroogde kruiden as regards what I think that authority calls ‘the water art’ .
 
How beautiful Fritz Reuter’s work is .
I do think you’ll find the Erckmann-Chatrian beautiful .
Must also tell you that I recently got hold of a splendid old Scheveningen woman’s cape and a hat , but the hat isn’t beautiful . And I’m also to get a skipper’s jacket with a stand-up collar and short sleeves . I’d dearly like to see your charcoal drawing , perhaps when my brother comes — I don’t know exactly when yet — I could go with him to Brabant and then come for a look while passing Utrecht . Perhaps if I can manage it I’ll come anyway sometime , for I would like to see it .
For your part , make sure you come to The Hague again , for the wedding you spoke of then . If I carry on having such success as just recently in finding models , I’ll certainly do one or two things in large drawings this summer .
Now I want to continue with those I’m working on to get them to the same level , if possible , by the time my brother comes .
In Harper’s Weekly I see a very true thing after Smedley — a black figure of a man on a white sandy road . He calls it ‘a generation ago’ . It’s the figure of a kind of minister perhaps ; the impression it made on me was: yes , my grandfather was like that . I wish I had done it . In the same number after Abbey two girls fishing on the bank of a ditch with pollard willows . In Harper’s they’re both just croquis in a review of an exhibition .
 
I would send you croquis of the drawings but I haven’t got much time .
I asked permission to draw in the old men’s and women’s home here but that has been refused me . Still , there are more homes in the villages around here . But here I knew a few people whom I could use as models . I was there , though , to have a look , and saw among others a gardener next to an old , crooked apple tree that was very real .
Well , there’s my model . Adieu , send the Harpers if you can do without them , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
