Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’m rather surprised that you haven’t written to me once these last few days . However , like the previous time when you went to Holland , it’s above all sheer chance .
Now I hope that all these things have gone well for you .
In the meantime I’ve been obliged to ask Tasset for 10 metres of canvas and a few tubes .
Also I still need

I have 6 spring studies , including two large orchards . It’s very urgent , because these effects are so fleeting .
 
So write to me by return . I’ve taken an apartment of 2 small rooms at 6 (or 8 francs a month , water included) which belong to Mr Rey . It’s certainly not expensive , but not nearly as nice as the other studio .
But to be able to move home and send you a consignment of canvases I would have to pay the other . And that’s why I was more or less stunned that you hadn’t sent me anything . But anyway .
Hoping again that all those marriage matters went off to your liking , wishing you and your lots of happiness with all my heart
Ever yours ,
Vincent
Signac has asked me to join him in Cassis , but seeing as we have enough expenses without that , whatever I do or you do it isn’t within our means .
