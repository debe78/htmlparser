Letter|My dear Theo ,
A few words to wish you and your ée much happiness these days . It’s like a nervous tic with me that on the occasion of a day of celebration I generally experience difficulties in formulating a congratulation , but it shouldn’t be concluded from that that I desire your happiness less ardently than anyone else , as you well know .
I still have to thank you for your last letter , as well as for the consignment of colours from Tasset and several issues of Le Fifre with drawings by Forain . The latter have often had the effect on me that what I manufacture becomes very sentimental in comparison .
I waited a few days before replying , not knowing which day you would leave for Amsterdam , besides I also don’t know whether it’s in Breda or Amsterdam that you’ll be getting married . But if , as I’m led to believe , it will be in Amsterdam , then I presumed that you would find this letter there around Sunday .
By the way — just today friend Roulin came to see me — he told me to give you his warm regards and to congratulate you . His visit gave me considerable pleasure , he often has to carry burdens which one would say were too heavy . As he has a strong peasant nature , that doesn’t prevent him from always looking well and even joyful — however for me , who am always learning something new from him , what lessons for the future there are in his conversation when he seems to say that the road doesn’t become easier as one advances in life .
  I talked with him to have his opinion on what I ought to do as regards the studio , which I must leave in any case , as I was advised by Mr Salles and Rey , at Easter . I told Roulin that having done many things to put this house in a much better state than I had taken it in , and above all for the gas which I had put in , I considered it as a piece of work we have done .
I’m being forced to leave — all right — but to take away the gas — to make a fuss for damages or something else , certainly there would be justification but I don’t have the heart for it . The only thing that I find possible in this case is to tell ourselves that we’d have tried to set up a habitation for unknown successors .
And besides , before seeing Roulin I had already been to the gasworks to arrange it so . And Roulin was of the same opinion . He’s planning to remain in Marseille .
I’m well these days , apart from a certain vague background sadness that’s hard to define — but anyway — I’ve gained physical powers rather than lose them , and I’m working .
Just now I have on the easel an orchard of peach trees beside a road with the Alpilles in the background . It appears that there’s a fine article on Monet in Le Figaro , Roulin had read it and had been struck by it , he said .
 
All in all it’s quite a difficult question to resolve , to take a new apartment , and even to find it , especially by the month . Mr Salles spoke to me of a house at 20 francs which is very good , but he isn’t sure that I’ll be able to have it .
At Easter I’ll have to pay 3 months’ rent , the removal costs &amp ; c . All that is neither cheering nor convenient . Especially since absolutely nothing promises us better luck .
Roulin was saying , or rather made it understood , that he didn’t at all like the anxiety that has reigned here in Arles this winter , even considered completely outside the share that fell on me . Anyway , it’s like that just about everywhere , business affairs that aren’t going well , worn-out resources , discouraged people and — — — — as you were saying , not content to remain spectators and becoming wicked through lack of occupation . If someone still laughs or works , they come down on him fast .
Anyway , my dear brother , I think that soon I’ll no longer be ill enough to remain confined . Apart from that , I’m beginning to get accustomed to it , and if I had to remain in a hospital for good I would get used to it , and I think that I could find subjects for painting there as well .
 
Write to me soon if you find the time .
Roulin’s family was still out in the country , and although he’s earning a little more , since the separate expenses are increased in proportion , they’re not a mite better off in reality , and he wasn’t without very distressing anxieties . Fortunately the weather is fine and the sun glorious , and the people here momentarily quickly forget all their troubles and then glow with energy and illusions .
These last few days I’ve been reading Dickens’s Contes de Noël , in which there are things so profound that one must re-read them often , it has a very great deal in common with Carlyle .
While Roulin isn’t exactly old enough to be like a father to me , all the same he has silent solemnities and tendernesses for me like an old soldier would have for a young one . Always — but without a word — a certain something that seems to mean: we don’t know what will happen to us tomorrow , but think of me in any event . And that does one good when it comes from a man who is neither embittered nor sad , nor perfect , nor happy , nor always irreproachably just , but such a good soul and so wise and so moved and so full of belief . Listen — I have no right to complain of anything to do with Arles when I think of certain people I’ve seen there and whom I’ll never be able to forget .
It’s late , once again I wish you and Jo much happiness , and handshakes in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
