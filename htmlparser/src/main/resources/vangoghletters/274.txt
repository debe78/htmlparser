My dear Theo ,
Your letter and the enclosure gave me very great pleasure , I don’t need to tell you that . It’s just what was needed and is a mighty help to me .
It’s still autumnal weather here — rainy and chilly , but full of atmosphere — especially good for figures , which show a range of tones on the wet streets and roads in which the sky is reflected . It’s what Mauve , above all , does so beautifully time and again .
As a result I’ve been able to do some more to the large watercolour of the crowd of people in front of the lottery office , and I’ve also just started another of the beach , of which this is the composition .
[sketch A]
I can agree entirely with what you say about times one occasionally has when one seems to be deadened to the things of nature , or when nature no longer seems to speak to us .
I , too , often have that , and sometimes it helps if I turn to something very different . If I’m dead to landscape or effects of light , I tackle figures , and vice versa . Sometimes there’s nothing to be done except wait for it to pass , but on many occasions I manage to get rid of the unresponsiveness by changing the subjects I’m concentrating on . I’m becoming more and more fascinated by figures though . I remember having had a time in the past when the feeling for landscape was very strong within me , and I was much more struck by a painting or drawing in which a light effect or the mood of a landscape was well expressed than by figures . In general , the figure painters even inspired in me a kind of fairly cool respect rather than warm sympathy . However , I well remember being particularly struck at the time by a drawing by Daumier , an old man under the chestnut trees in the Champs Elysées (an illustration for Balzac) , although the drawing wasn’t that important . But I remember that it struck me so forcefully that there was something so firm and manly in Daumier’s approach that I thought: it must be good to feel and think like that and overlook or ignore a mass of things so as to concentrate on something that’s thought-provoking and appeals to a human being as a human being more directly than meadows or clouds .
 
And similarly the figures of either the English draughtsmen or the English writers , on account of their Monday morning-like sobriety and deliberate austerity and prose and analysis , continue to attract me as something solid and firm which gives one something to hold onto on days when one is feeling weak . And those of Balzac and Zola among the French writers just as much . As yet I don’t know the books by Murger you write about , but I hope to become acquainted with them .
Did I write to you before that I read Daudet’s Les rois en exil? I thought it rather beautiful .
The titles of those books sound very attractive , La bohème among others . How far we have strayed in our age from la bohème of Gavarni’s day! It seems to me that things were a little warmer then , and more good-humoured and livelier than now . But I don’t know , and there’s also much that’s good in the present , or would be more than is actually the case if there were rather more joining together .
At the moment a wonderful effect can be seen from the window of my studio . The city with its towers and roofs and smoking chimneys stands out as a dark , sombre silhouette against a horizon of light . The light , though , is only a broad strip ; above it hangs a heavy shower , more concentrated below , above torn by the autumn wind into great tufts and clumps that float off . But that strip of light makes the wet roofs glisten here and there in the sombre mass of the city (in a drawing you would lift it with a stroke of body-colour) , and ensures that , although the mass all has the same tone , you can still distinguish between red tiles and slates .
Schenkweg runs through the foreground as a glistening line through the wet , the poplars have yellow leaves , the banks of the ditch and the meadow are deep green , figures are black .
I would draw it , or rather try to draw it , if I hadn’t spent the whole afternoon toiling at figures of peat carriers which are still too much in my mind for there to be room for something new , and must remain there .
 
I do so often long for you and think of you so much . What you write about some characters in Paris , about artists who live with women , are less petty-minded than others perhaps , try desperately to stay young , seems well observed to me . Such people exist there and here . It’s perhaps even more difficult there than here for a person to keep some freshness in domestic life , because that’s almost more of an uphill struggle there . How many have become desperate in Paris — calmly , rationally , logically and rightly desperate? I read something along these lines about Tassaert , among others , whom I like very much , and was pained by what happened to him .
All the more , all the more , I think every attempt in this direction is worthy of respect . I also believe that it may happen that one succeeds and one mustn’t begin by despairing ; even if one loses here and there , and even if one sometimes feels a sort of decline , the point is nevertheless to revive and have courage , even though things don’t turn out as one first thought . Moreover , don’t think that I look with contempt on people such as you describe because their life isn’t founded on serious and well-considered principles . My view on this is as follows: the result must be an action , not an abstract idea . I think principles are good and worth the effort only when they develop into deeds , and I think it’s good to reflect and to try to be conscientious , because that makes a person’s will to work more resolute and turns the various actions into a whole . I think that people such as you describe would get more steadiness if they went about what they do more rationally , but otherwise I much prefer them to people who make a great show of their principles without making the slightest effort to put them into practice or even giving that a thought . For the latter have no use for the finest of principles , and the former are precisely the people who , if they ever get round to living with willpower and reflection , will do something great . For the great doesn’t happen through impulse alone , and is a succession of little things that are brought together .
 
What is drawing? How does one get there? It’s working one’s way through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do . How can one get through that wall? — since hammering on it doesn’t help at all . In my view , one must undermine the wall and grind through it slowly and patiently . And behold , how can one remain dedicated to such a task without allowing oneself to be lured from it or distracted , unless one reflects and organizes one’s life according to principles? And it’s the same with other things as it is with artistic matters . And the great isn’t something accidental ; it must be willed . Whether originally deeds lead to principles in a person or principles lead to deeds is something that seems to me as unanswerable and as little worth answering as the question of which came first , the chicken or the egg .
But I believe it’s a positive thing and of great importance that one should try to develop one’s powers of thought and will .
I’m very curious about what you’ll think of the figures I’m doing at present , when you see them sooner or later . It’s the same with them as with the question of the chicken and the egg: should one make figures for a composition one has done first , or combine the figures made separately so that the composition flows from them? I believe it comes down to the same thing . Just as long as one works . I end with that with which you close your letter — that we have in common a liking for seeing behind the scenes or , in other words , are inclined to analyze things . Now this , I believe , is exactly the quality one must have in order to paint — one must exercise this power when painting or drawing . It may be that there has to be something innate in us , to some extent (but that too you have , and so do I — for that we may have to thank our childhood in Brabant and a background that helped , much more than is usually the case , to teach us to think) , but above all , above all , it’s only later that the artistic sense develops and ripens through working . How you might become a very good painter I don’t know , but I certainly believe that it is in you and will come out .
Adieu , old chap , thanks for what you sent , and a hearty handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I have the stove in place already — old chap , how I wish we could look at drawings and sketches for an evening sometime — and woodcuts . I have some more splendid ones .
This week I hope to have orphan boys to pose , then I may be able to rescue the drawing of orphan children after all .
