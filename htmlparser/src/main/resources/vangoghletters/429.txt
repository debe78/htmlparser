Letter|My dear Theo ,
Today I sent a parcel to your address containing 3 small panels and 9 watercolours . Please let me know whether you’ve received it . If there’s anything in it you like , so much the better . Ma is going on much the same . Am still working on various weavers , which you’ll get later .
Lies has left again , it’s a lot of hard work for Wil .
Regards .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
