Letter|My dear Vincent
Life is very long and very sad . Since your last letter I’ve been so deep in the doldrums that I couldn’t write , in the daytime wishing to see the evening , and at night awaiting the morning . Once the land is ploughed , the man casts the seed , and each day defending himself against the vagaries of the bad weather he manages to harvest . But what of us poor artists? Where does the seed we plant go , and when does the harvest come? In the 3 months I’ve been at Le Pouldu I’ve had 30 francs in my pocket ; it’s obviously pointless my putting energy into it , I can’t carry on painting .
 
Apart from these money troubles I’ve had other causes for sorrow . I almost lost one of my , who fell from the 3rd floor into the street . You will understand that in Copenhagen the household was overwhelmed , and that the expenses occasioned by this accident are throwing things into chaos (chaos which I’m powerless to remedy at the moment) . All of this makes me sick with spleen , and I dare neither paint nor write . And why paint?
I very much like the 2 drawings you sent me , especially the one of the women who are picking olives .
I’m pleased that you’ve exhibited in Brussels ; have you any news of this exhibition . Let me know .
Like us you have winter
  at the moment , and I know that for you it’s a harsh time to get through . You’re probably awaiting the heat with impatience so that you can work out of doors .
I’m doing everything I can at the moment to leave for Tonkin at government expense , but it isn’t easy , especially because I’m an artist and people don’t believe that they have any capacity for business . In the colonies there’s something for us westerners to do , and I hope to learn something new there in art at the same time as being relieved of financial worries for a time .
De Haan is still working here with me and making serious progress , but doesn’t want to return to Holland until
  he feels strong enough to silence his compatriots ; they’re going to say harsh words to him about his transformation . These new questions of colour had greatly tormented him , but today , when he’s beginning to see clearly in this new way , he’s full of ardour .
Excuse my delay in writing , and believe me always
Ever yours cordially ,
Paul Gauguin
