Letter|My dear friend Rappard .
I received your telegram this morning . I was on the point of coming to you when I heard you were indisposed . But on reflection I changed my mind because I thought that the doctor might take the view that it wouldn’t be good for you to talk , &amp ; c .
I believe otherwise that you yourself would not object — I too wouldn’t be at all concerned that it would harm you . On the contrary indeed , there’s something peculiar in the temperament of every painter . Momentary weakness , nervousness , melancholy are often caused by the effort of working — at the same time , though , there’s a kind of rebound , and the weakness &amp ; c . &amp ; c . is cured precisely by making an effort .
If someone is weak and has had more than enough of reasoning and discussing with friends , it might do him good to be solitary for a while , but as far as I know this isn’t the case with you .
  So I considered coming to you .
But I thought , Rappard has fathers , mothers , sisters , brothers , maids , servants , and I don’t know what else at home , and they can all be on sentry duty to keep him quiet if the doctor has said something like that . Now if one arrives at such a moment , the pleasure is gone and you sit facing each other in embarrassment . For my part , though , I tell you frankly , at times I clearly feel the two forces of exhaustion and recovery in my own temperament due to one and the same cause , the effort put into work . And I trust in this so much , not only for myself but for others too , that when I was ill last year , for example , I brazenly acted against the doctor’s advice in some respects , not because I thought his advice was wrong
  or that I knew better , but because I reasoned to myself: I live to paint and not primarily to conserve my constitution . Sometimes the mysterious words , whosoever will lose his life shall find it , are as clear as daylight . I was cured MORE SPEEDILY than a few others of whom I know how long they took to recover from the same thing .
But — dear friend — I write what I would otherwise certainly say to you — save your strength in the sense of not expending it on matters that don’t lead directly to your goal . I say the same of church ornaments as of making decorations . In my view this is using up powder on something that may be worth a shot of powder in itself , if need be , from someone who has a full cartridge box and can refill it when it’s empty , but — my dear friend — not a cartridge from a soldier on whose alertness important matters may depend and whose position puts greater responsibility on his shoulders than on other people’s .
What’s permitted to others may be reprehensible in you , since in this case the better is the enemy of the good . Ergo , save yourself for the better .
 
Do you share my opinion as to your responsibility and what depends on your post? I’m not certain about it . There are two points of view with everybody: what one is , what one could be . We may not confine ourselves in the first , it seems to me , with a ‘clear’ conscience . We should feel the second as a formidable reality above us since , imperfect and full of faults as we are , we’re never justified in stifling the ideal , and what extends into the infinite as if it were no concern of ours . I have a few reasons for finding your post highly important in the circumstances . Perhaps my feeling towards you is more sombre as a result . I wonder , what will R . do? Which side will he choose?
But now isn’t the moment to philosophize about that . So to business . I have a particular desire to meet you soon . I’ve seen absolutely nothing by you for a year , longer even , because I didn’t see anything last year either when you were here . Also , you’ve seen little of my work — nothing other than the lithographs .
So , if you agree , we must arrange things so that we see each other , and visit each other in turn . So my proposal is that you let me know on which day there would be no obstacle to my coming to your studio for a morning . As long as you have these symptoms of coughing blood , I don’t think it exaggerated to say that there are objections to your coming here . So let’s agree to postpone that until these symptoms have gone completely . But the very first day that you’re back to your normal ways without disagreeing with your doctor , I’ll come to see you as soon as I hear one word from you .
As you see , I’m writing to you even before receiving the letter mentioned in your telegram . But I don’t expect it to change much in this plan , but rather to endorse it .
 
Don’t imagine I’m against all decorations or ornaments — but I’m against them at this time and in the circumstances we’re now facing here in Holland . I’m not against them if a certain surplus of vigour is absorbed in that direction at a time of great enthusiasm and a spirit of energy and renaissance . But I’m against them at a time when enthusiasm and energy aren’t exactly the prevailing mood — especially among the young — so let those who have energy concentrate .
There’s a time to be merry but there’s also a time to be severe . Truly , then it’s necessary that one does not share the confidence about everything going well , which is more or less the convention at present , and could end up in a periwig age — when they drank a glass &amp ; c . and left things as they were . When there is decline — then no ornaments , please — but a quest for inner fellowship with ‘the old hands of yesterday’ , and ignore the present .
Some matters , my dear friend , take precedence in my mind over one’s own private concerns or private difficulties . These last are also not the immediate motive if I desire to speak to you . Thus now I’ve talked about other things before getting round to thanking you for being ready to help me , which reassures me greatly and will spare me having to take distasteful measures . Thank you for that . If I talk about things in general , actually I detest doing such a thing .
It will be the same if I come to you — I can’t conceal the fact that I , for one , can’t see the future clearly , and consider it doubtful whether I’ll be able to do what I propose to do . So I seek to have your advice to perhaps get some light . I believe you have a certain eye for my work , and in some cases
  your judgement could be of great use to me when I have the studies for something , for example , in shaping them into the final whole . Now at the moment I have many studies and 2 or 3 more important compositions are dawning in my mind for which I probably have most of the material in my studies .
Precisely because I value your opinion , it’s necessary for you to know something of my thoughts too . And I believe you probably have enough power of contemplation to understand my vision even when you don’t agree with me about everything .
If I have something against a new movement , it isn’t at all that of Israëls , Mauve and Maris . No , that’s simply the best in my view , but something has since arisen from it which , while resembling it , is in fact directly opposed to those masters — and that’s what I’m against . Van der Weele , for instance , is more serious and sticks to a straight line . I saw his studies last Sunday .
Now I believe that you also have a straight line , but I wonder whether some things aren’t more deviations in the direction described . I’m ready to withdraw this opinion , but that’s how it appears to me .
Now , for my part I too am looking for that line which I think is the best , that of let’s say Israëls , Mauve , Maris . I don’t even know how far I’ve advanced along it — much less how far I’ll yet advance — but I’ve done my best at it and shall continue to do my best . And this being so , if , for example , I see objections to your decorations , it’s as far from my intention as the north is from the south to do this in a schoolmasterly way or tone , but only as one who is himself searching for something true and sound — and serious not because I’ve already found it but serious because I’m myself searching for it .
And all I think regarding not only you , but certainly myself no less , is that we must be on our guard against the diffuse and search for concentration and pith . And if I come to you — truly , it’s with a view to what concerns practice , and not about theory or philosophy , that I want to talk to you .
With a view to practice , as prosaic as Monday morning .
 
You write about a beautiful print in The Graphic by Howard Pyle . If you mean a composition that recalls Ter Borch or Nicolaes de Keyser — Penn and the colonists — it struck me too — so much so that I ordered that issue . Yes , it’s deuced beautiful . In the same way I took an issue of London News for the sake of a sheet by King — Workmen in a wagon of the Underground Railway .
I’ve also subscribed to Dumas’s le Salon 1883 , of which the first issue is out at 1 franc and which will be complete in 12 monthly instalments .
I greatly regret that you didn’t come after all , but it wasn’t your fault .
Up to now I had some qualms about coming to you , because so many prefer not to see me and I generally don’t look forward to paying visits . And part of the reason for that is also because I’ve taken the and her two into my house , and they think they can’t decently have anything to do with me . But having provisionally learned from you yourself that your opinion is different from that of others , I believe I can give up my qualms . I deal with it by not seeking out those who avoid me for this reason ,
  I prefer to stay away from places rather than to be unwelcome . All the more so since I can slightly , slightly , slightly , but only a very tiny bit , excuse the prejudice of those who are just observing or trying to observe social conventions and accept them as they are , above all because I regard them as weak and don’t want to fight , at least not attack . In this respect , too , I CERTAINLY save my cartridges . Is this too pedantic?
Take me as I am and let us agree that I’ll hear from you when I can visit you without going against what your doctor prescribes .
And thank you again for being willing to help me , and your letter will be welcome when it comes , but if your condition means that you must put off writing , then let it wait .
Adieu , with a handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
