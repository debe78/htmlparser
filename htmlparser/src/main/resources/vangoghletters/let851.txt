Letter|My dear Mr Ginoux,
Certainly I would prefer to come in person to ask you how your is, just as I had also hoped to come back to see you around now. But having been indisposed myself this last week, I must ask you for news of her by letter.
Please don‘t fail to let me know how she is – for would be worried if I didn‘t have news from you by return of post.
Nevertheless I have good intentions enough to come next week, however.
I had news of Mr Paul again the other day, and it‘s possible I may soon go and see him, especially because I also have a great desire
  to go and make the acquaintance of my brother‘s one, who has fortunately just been born safe and sound.
So for myself I‘m really pleased that this is going well, all the more so because work isn‘t going too badly either, having had articles on my paintings both in Belgium and in Paris where I exhibited them, and people are saying much more good things about them than I myself would wish.
I‘m expecting a visit from a Marseille any day now, so this is another reason why I don‘t know precisely which day I‘ll be able to come and see you.
That notwithstanding, as for myself the attack I had again has
  completely passed again, and I‘m working as usual.
Anyway, I hope you won‘t leave me pining for your reply.
Kind regards to you and to Mrs Ginoux, and all my wishes for her speedy recovery.
Handshake to both of you and to our other friends, and believe me
Yours truly,
Vincent van Gogh
