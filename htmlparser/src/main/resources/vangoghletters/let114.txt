My dear Theo ,
What a good day we spent together , one we shall certainly remember . I want to make sure that you find a letter when you return from Etten . You’ll certainly have had a good time at home , write soon to say how you spent the day .
Herewith you receive something for your portfolio , namely a lithograph after J . Maris , beneath which one might write: a poor man in the kingdom of God , and a lithograph after Mollinger . Had you seen this one before? I hadn’t . From a Jewish bookseller , who gets me the Latin and Greek books I need , I had the opportunity of choosing what I wanted from a large batch , and not at all expensive , 13 for 70 cents . Thought I’d take several for my room , to give it some atmosphere , which is necessary to get and refresh ideas .
I’ll give you a list , then you’ll know what it looks like and what’s hanging there .
1 after Jamin (which is also hanging in your room) , one after M . Maris , that little boy going to school , 5 after Bosboom — Van der Maaten , Funeral in the cornfield – Israëls , a poor man walking on a snowy road in winter , and Van Ostade , studio . Then there’s Allebé , a little old woman who has collected water and coals on a winter morning with snow on the streets . I sent that last one to Cor for his birthday . The Jewish bookseller had many more beautiful things but I can’t afford any more , and even though I’m hanging a few up , I’m not going to start collecting .
Yesterday Uncle Cor sent me a batch of old paper , such as the sheet on which I’m writing to you . Isn’t it wonderful for doing my work on?
I have a lot of work already , and it isn’t easy , but meekness will help one to get used to it . I only hope to bear in mind the ivy , ‘which stealeth on though he wears no wings’ . Like the ivy on the walls , so the pen must cover the paper .
Every day I go for a long walk . I recently came across a very nice part when I walked all the way down Buitenkant to the Hollandsche Spoor station , where there were people working with sand-carts &amp ; c . on the IJ , and I walked along all kinds of narrow little streets with gardens full of ivy . It was somehow similar to Ramsgate .
At the station I turned left where all those mills are , down a street running alongside a canal lined with elm trees . Everything there puts one in mind of Rembrandt’s etchings .
One of these days I’ll be starting General History from the book by Streckfuss , or rather , I’ve already started it . It won’t be easy , but taking it one step at a time and doing it well must surely produce results , this I fervently hope . But it will take time: this has been attested to by many , and not just Corot ‘It took only forty years of work , thought and care . ’ For the work of men like Pa and the Rev . Keller van Hoorn , Uncle Stricker and so many others , a lot of practice is necessary , just as it is for painting . And a man says once in a while: however will I manage that?
 
And one’s own deeds , ideas and observation aren’t enough , we need the comfort and blessing and guidance of a higher power , and anyone with any earnestness and a desire to illumine his soul will recognize and experience this . Godly sorrow acts like leaven in dough . May that also be seen in the story of both our lives .
Let us only believe in God and , holding fast to that belief , have faith in Him:
God firmly spoke on mount and rock
And set this word in stone
And all who view this sacred writ
May read the words intoned .
The hardest rock will one day crumble
The highest mount come tumbling down
But this my covenant with Thee ,
O Upright One , remaineth sound .
He who lets the Lord provide ,
And hopes for His aid in times of peril ,
Will find protection at God’s side ,
Be saved as by a miracle .
He whose faith rests in God’s hands
Will not have built on shifting sands .
Doing whatever the hand finds to do , and , if we are pushed in the right direction and a door is opened unto us , as it were , proceeding in that direction , we may have something of the faith of old , which God pours into many a heart , into that of the mean as well as that of the mighty , into that of Aertsen as well as that of Pa or Uncle Jan or Uncle Cor — Rembrandt , Millet , Bosboom and how many others experienced the same thing . Yes , we can observe it , or at least traces of it , in nearly everyone , to a greater or lesser extent . He is not far from every one of us .
Is Mrs Tersteeg continuing to do well , and have you already been to see Mauve? Just be steadfast , as you are doing , there can be good days in store for us if God wishes to spare our lives and give His blessing to what we do . Will you ever attend some little church of mine? May God grant it , and I believe that He shall . Meanwhile let us simply be grateful for our everyday life – if we are not confronted with anything unusual , and if we know a good prayer , then let us say it , like the one Pa once said on New Year’s Eve when it was very cold and the winter was not easy on anyone , our own household either – that prayer came from the secret recesses of his heart: O Lord , join us intimately to one another and let our Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger , preserve us from all evil , especially the evil of sin . Father , we pray not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world , but that Thou shouldest keep us from the evil . ‘Preserve us from too much self-reproach . ’ Let us find grace in the eyes of those to whom we are closest and in the eyes of those who shall come after us . Whenever I look at a painting by Ruisdael , Van Goyen , Bosboom and so many others , I always think of the words ‘as sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing’ . Of woe-spiritedness .
Will you come again on a Sunday to my study , and shall we go again together to the little church at Scheveningen? I hope so .
Give my regards to your housemates , and accept in thought a handshake from
Your most loving brother ,
Vincent
Yesterday I saw a portrait of Michelet and looked at it again closely and thought of ‘his life of ink and paper’ . In the evenings I’m tired and can’t get up as early as I’d like , but that will surely improve , and I hope I can force myself to do so .
On Whit Monday I hope to be at Uncle Stricker’s in the afternoon and evening .
