Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
Several days have now passed since I began looking through The Graphics .
If I were to write to you about all the beautiful things in them , and if my descriptions weren’t merely superficial , the result really would be a heavy volume .
Nonetheless , I can’t resist mentioning a few prints that are absolutely matchless .
For example , The foundling by Frank Holl . This shows several policemen in waterproof capes who have taken up a child left as a foundling between the beams and planks of a quay beside the Thames . Some curious onlookers watch , and through the fog one sees the grey silhouette of the city in the background .
Then there’s a funeral , also by him , several people going into a churchyard , beautiful in sentiment . He calls that print: I am the Resurrection and the Life .
Then there’s another funeral by Nash , only on board a ship . One sees the corpse by the railing . The sailors stand beside it and the captain reads the liturgy .
One 3rd-class waiting room by Holl is known to you from a little print of it that I sent you this summer , but in The Graphic there’s the large one , infinitely finer .
I noticed the work of C . Green some time ago but didn’t know he could make things as beautiful as , for instance , his ‘bench in the hospital’ , patients who are waiting to see the doctor . Also by him a quay in Liverpool , and Land once more , passengers coming ashore from a ship . Here they come , spectators at the Derby (Buckman also did the same thing with the same title excellently) . I didn’t know Gordon Thompson before , spectators at the Derby by him too , ‘Clapham road’ (as it happens , close to where I used to live) . This print is unbelievably good ; it resembles Dürer or Quinten Massys , for example .
 
You know the work of Percy Macquoid , of Heilbuth , of Tissot , when one sees that it seems as if it’s the non plus ultra of elegance and soft , delicate feeling . In a sense , indeed , this is the non plus ultra . Still , compared with them , Pinwell and Fred Walker are what the nightingale is to the lark . In a sheet in The Graphic called The sisters , for example , Pinwell draws two women in black in a dark room , the simplest possible composition , in which he has put a serious sentiment that I can only compare to the full song of the nightingale on a spring night . There are two other sketches by him , Baby’s home , and a splendid sheet , among others , by Fred Walker , The old gate and The harbour of refuge .
The work by Herkomer in it (I’m not counting the prints I already had) includes Divine service (pews in a church) , Treat to the Whitechapel poor . Lodging house St Giles , The workhouse (women) , charcoal burners — Wirthshaus — The cardinals walk , Rome , Skittle alley . Carnival time , Anxious times , Arrest of a poacher . Then (apart from the large figures from it) the very first sketch of The last muster entitled Sunday at Chelsea . In a later volume it says of this print that when Herkomer first presented it no one on the board of The Graphic liked it except the manager , who ordered a more detailed drawing from Herkomer and immediately placed the sketch .
That’s how things can change in the world , for later there’s a sheet in The Graphic of the spectators around the final painting of The last muster .
 
You know the head of a miner by Ridley . I now have a boat race spectators by him , and already had a hospital , both thorough , solid prints .
But something new by him is a series of 6 or 7 prints , miners , pits and pitmen , that recall etchings by Whistler or Seymour Haden , Staniland , The rush to the pit’s mouth , also in the mining region .
One print that particularly struck me is Abbey , Xmas in old Virginia engraved by Swain . This drawing was evidently done entirely with the pen — like , for instance , those by Caldecott and Barnard , but large figures .
Small has a superb drawing of Caxton showing specimens of his printing to the king . It recalls Leys . Of course there are many beautiful things by Small , but this and the ploughing match are the finest by him that I know . A queue in Paris during the siege by him is splendid , as are several London sketches and Irish sketches .
Green also has The girl I left behind me , especially good too , it’s a troop of returning soldiers , and the meeting of one of them with his girl , who has remained faithful to him .
Irish churchyard is no less beautiful . Boughton , Waning of the honeymoon .
Nash . Labourers meeting and Life boat and Sunday evening at sea .
Gregory , Hospital and Paris during the siege .
Buckman , Hampstead Heath .
Fildes has a scene in the courtyard of a prison where policemen are holding onto a thief or murderer so that his photograph can be taken . The chap refuses to submit to this and puts up a struggle . In the other corner of the composition the photographer and onlookers .
 
There are many fine ones by Boyd Houghton , most of them smaller compositions from America that one would think were etchings , but also large prints , Paris under the red flag , Mormon tabernacle , Cabin of emigrant ship , that don’t resemble anything else . The details are amazingly worked up , and the appearance is something like an etching by — well , by whom — by Fortuny perhaps , or Whistler . Most curious .
Edwin Edwards , The foundling , Sea bathing , The meet &amp ; c .
Two sheets — I don’t know by whom — from the Russo-Turkish War , Osman Pasha and an old battleground , which are remarkable for their reality .
Stocks Sermon	and Last sacrament
Hodgson	Navvies and Fishing
Gow	No surrender
Lawson	Imprisoned spring
Small	Swan upping , Game of polo , Boatrace . Queens ladies , R . Academy , Walking match
Green	An artist on stone , Outsiders betting
Well , it’s easy to start on a list , but leaving off is a different matter ; that’s difficult . There’s so much more , there’s really no end to it . For I’m speaking now almost exclusively of the large prints . Just to mention one , among the smaller is 93 by Victor Hugo illustrated by Herkomer , Green , Small — rarely has a book been illustrated in such a way — how fortunate that it’s that book , so fully worthy of it .
But 1 year is missing from the collection , namely the first . However , I already had some fine sheets from it , among them Fildes , Applicants at a casual ward (Home and the homeless) and Fildes , The empty chair (Dickens’s studio) .
Write to me soon — now that you’re better .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
To top it all , this week I got another two volumes (1876) — I took them because there are outstanding prints in them which , though I already have them , I want to have as many times as I can find — including the old wives by Herkomer , that’s a masterpiece . Have you got that???
 
A fine female figure by Percy Macquoid , During the reign of terror .
Small sketches too , cats — Chinese — mackerel fishing .
At last a large print , a corner of a studio — a manikin that has fallen over , draperies which two dogs are playing with . Precious but it satisfies me less , I find it a little pedantic and too refined . There’s one more splendid illustration by Fildes (for a novel) , two men in a churchyard at twilight .
You’ll understand that I’m in two minds about the following question . If I cut the prints out and mount them , they look better like that and can be arranged by the draughtsmen who made them . But then I damage the text , which is useful in many ways if one wants to look up something , about exhibitions say , although the reviews of them are very superficial .
One also damages , for example , the novels , like Hugo’s 93 .
And it costs a good deal in mounting paper . It’s quite certain , though , the large prints in particular look infinitely better mounted than with a fold through the middle . And that one has a better overall view when they’re arranged by draughtsman .
But actually isn’t it ridiculous that here in an artistic city like The Hague someone like me should be the highest bidder at a public book auction? One would expect other bidders to come forward , but no . I myself didn’t think I would get them .
 
The Jew had talked to me about them before the auction . I said that I would like to but couldn’t think of buying something like that . Then later he told me he’d bought them at his own risk because almost no one was bidding , and if I wanted them he had them . Then it became a different matter and my brother helped me to buy them dirt cheap — one guilder a volume .
Pleased as I am to have them , at the same time I feel sad that there’s so little demand for them . It’s wonderful for me to find such a treasure , but I would rather that demand was such that I couldn’t obtain them for the time being .
Oh Rappard — it’s the same as with other things — much that is of great value is paid no attention nowadays , and looked down upon as ballast , rubbish or scrap paper .
Don’t you find something very dull about these times? Or is it my imagination? A certain lack of passion and warmth and open-heartedness . The ‘dealers’ and their cronies may claim that ‘it’s in the nature of things that the desired change will come’ (isn’t this explanation very satisfactory?) , but for my part I don’t see that ‘in the nature of things’ so clearly . Be that as it may , it isn’t unpleasant to look through a Graphic , and while doing so one can’t help thinking very egotistically , What do I care? I don’t plan to be bored even if it is a dull age . But one isn’t always egotistic , and one sometimes bitterly regrets it when one isn’t .
