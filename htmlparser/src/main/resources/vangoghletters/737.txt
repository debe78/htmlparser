Letter|My dear Vincent
Don’t bother yourself with the studies that I deliberately left in Arles as not being worth the trouble of transporting them . On the other hand the sketchbooks contain notes which are useful to me , and I accept your offer to send them to me . As well as the 2 masks and gloves —
c/o Mr Schuffenecker
29 rue Boulard
Milliet’s address is
2nd lieutenant 3rd Zouaves
Guelma — Place de Constantine
Algeria
 
I regret that I inadvertently took it with me (all my apologies) . I’ve seen Bernard twice since I arrived in Paris . He has a very good chance of not being a soldier because of his narrow chest , and he won’t know his fate until the end of February . It appears that his is bothering him more and more on account of the painting and the unfortunate letter I wrote to his family .
No , I haven’t done any portraits yet , having spent my time on errands . Now that I have a studio in which I sleep , I’m going to put myself to work . I’ve begun a
  series of lithographs to be published in order to get myself known . Moreover , it’s on your brother’s advice and under his auspices .
I’m going to buckle down to the portraits of the whole Schuffenecker family , he , his wife and his 2 children in vermilion aprons . It’s darned cold in Paris at the moment — in addition I’ve amused myself doing croquis at the market , and I’m going to get some porters from the market to pose with their big hats , carrying sacks and sides of meat . I’m carried away at top speed by it .
I don’t know if I’ll go to
  Brussels , everything will depend on the money situation , and that’s as clear as mud . In any case , if I go there I’ll remember the advice you gave me about it — I don’t know , for example , if my weak voice will be heard . In any case the common good interests me enormously , and I’ll try to do the right thing .
Cordially yours ,
Paul Gauguin
