Letter|My dear ,
In recent days I already began another letter in reply to yours , but I became aware that I didn’t have sufficient mastery of my mind to write . I thank you and Lies for the Rod book which I’ve finished and which I’ll return to you soon . The terrible title , Le sens de la vie , terrified me a little , but as it’s happily scarcely spoken of in this volume , I was quite content to read something which has a family resemblance to Souvestre’s Le philosophe sous les toits or with Monsieur , madame et bébé by Droz . The moral of it is that in some cases a gentleman ends up preferring to live with a nice , devoted wife and his child , to the life of the restaurant , boulevard and café which he had previously led without too much excess . That’s undoubtedly very pleasant .
It is indeed remarkable that good Mrs du Quesne’s illness came to an unexpected end after all . It must have been a day of great deliverance for her all the same .
If you say in your letter that when you see so many others in life who come and go , seeking their own path , appearing to you perhaps to be making more headway than you , what can I tell you , that I too sometimes have a feeling of stupefaction in the face of my own life , and as regards several other lives of workers in my profession besides . I’ve just sent Theo a dozen drawings after canvases which I have on the go , while all the rest of my life is absolutely as inept as it was at the time when , at the age of 12 , I was at a boarding school where I learned absolutely nothing .
An enormous number of painters who certainly couldn’t do my 12 canvases either in 2 months or in 12 are regarded as artists and as intelligent people in town or in the countryside . But believe me , I say this in order to be explanatory and not because I would see any urgency or possibility or desire to change things . We scarcely know life , we’re so unaware of its hidden aspects , anyway we’re living in an age when everything appears to be in its dotage and tottering , and it isn’t unfortunate to find a duty which forces us to stay calmly in our corner , occupied with a little simpler toil , with certain duties that retain some raison d’être .
 
In these days in which we live we risk coming back from a battle ashamed of having done battle .
So my who was with me in Arles and a few others have thus organized an exhibition in which , in good health , I would have taken part .
And what have they been able to do – almost nothing – and yet in their canvases there was something brand new , good , something to give me pleasure and make me enthusiastic for example , me , I can assure you of that . Among artists , we no longer know what to say to each other , we don’t know if we ought to laugh or cry about it , and doing , my word , neither one thing or the other , we are happiest when we find ourselves in possession of a little paint and canvas , the thing we also lack sometimes and which at least we can work on . But any idea of a regular life , any idea of awakening in ourselves or in others gentle ideas or sensations , all of this must necessarily appear pure utopia to us .
So although yesterday more than half a million francs were paid for Millet’s Angelus , don’t go believing that more souls will feel what was in Millet’s soul . Or that middle-class people or workers will begin to put in their houses the lithograph of that Millet Angelus , for example . Don’t go believing that the painters who are still working in Brittany among the peasants will have more encouragement for that matter , less of the same black famine that always surrounded Millet , above all more courage .
Alas , we often lack breath and faith , wrongly certainly but – and here we come back to the point – if , however , we want to work we must submit both to the stubborn harshness of the time and to our isolation , which is sometimes as hard to bear as exile . Now before us , after our years which have thus been lost , relatively speaking , poverty , illness , old age , madness and always exile . It is indeed the moment to say ‘blessed be Thebe , daughter of Telhui , priestess of Osiris , who never complained about anyone’ .
 
Cherishing the memory of good people , wouldn’t that be worth more than being among the ambitious ones on the whole?
I’m quite absorbed in reading the Shakespeare that Theo sent me here , where at last I’ll have the calm necessary to do a little more difficult reading . I’ve first taken the kings series , of which I’ve already read Richard II , Henry IV , Henry V and a part of Henry VI – as these dramas were the most unfamiliar to me . Have you ever read King Lear? But anyway , I think I shan’t urge you too much to read such dramatic books when I myself , returning from this reading , am always obliged to go and gaze at a blade of grass , a pine-tree branch , an ear of wheat , to calm myself .
So if you want to do as artists do , gaze upon the white and red poppies with the bluish leaves , with those buds raising themselves up on stems with gracious curves . The hours of trouble and battle will assuredly come and find us without our going to look for them .
The separation from Cor will be hard . And it’s going to happen really soon . What else can one do , thinking of all the things whose reason one doesn’t understand , but gaze upon the wheatfields . Their story is ours , for we who live on bread , are we not ourselves wheat to a considerable extent , at least ought we not to submit to growing , powerless to move , like a plant , relative to what our imagination sometimes desires , and to be reaped when we are ripe , as it is?
I tell you , as for myself I think it would be wisest not to wish to get better , not to wish to regain more strength than now , and I’ll probably grow accustomed to it , to being cracked . A little sooner , a little later , what can that matter to me?
What you write about Theo’s health I know completely , nevertheless it is my hope that married life will completely restore him . I believe his to be wise and loving enough to take lots of care of him and to see that he doesn’t just eat restaurant food , but that he gets back to
  Dutch cooking . Dutch cooking is good , and so let her turn herself into something of a cook , let her take on a reassuring outer appearance , even if it’s a little rough . Theo himself is obliged to be a Parisian , but with that he absolutely needs what reminds him of his youth and his past . I , who have neither wife nor child , I need to see the wheatfields , and it would be difficult for me to exist in a town for long . So , knowing his character , I’m optimistic that his marriage will do him an enormous amount of good . Before we can form an idea of his health we must allow them a little time to take root within each other .
And afterwards , I dare also hope , she’ll have found lots of ways to make his life a little more pleasant than was the case before . For he has seen hard times .
Anyway I must close this letter if I want it to go off today , and I don’t even have time to re-read it . So , if I’ve said too many silly things you will kindly excuse me . Look after yourself , don’t get too bored , and by cultivating your garden as you do , and the rest that you do , be well assured that you’re getting through a lot of work . I kiss you affectionately in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
