Letter|To Mr Jules Breton
at Courrières
It was about 25 years ago that a man from Granville left for England .
After his father’s death , his brothers fell out over the inheritance , and attempted above all to deprive him , in particular , of his share . Tired of quarrelling , he gave up his share to them and left as a poor man for London , where he obtained a post as a French teacher in a school .
He was 30 when he married an Englishwoman , a good deal younger than himself ; he had 1 child , a daughter . After he had been married for 7 or 8 years , his chest complaint became worse .
One of his friends then asked him if he still had any wish , to which he replied that before he died he would like to see his own country again .
His friend paid his travelling expenses .
And so he left for Granville , deathly ill , with his wife and his 6-year-old daughter .
  There he rented a room from some poor people living near the sea .
In the evening he would have himself carried to the shore and would watch the sun setting in the sea .
One evening , seeing that he was close to death , the people advised his wife that it was time to send for the priest , so that he could give the sick man the last rites .
His wife , who was Protestant , objected , but he said , ‘let them’ .
And so the priest arrived and the sick man made his confession before all the household .
Then all those present wept , hearing of this just and pure life .
Afterwards , he wished to be left alone with his wife , and when they were alone he kissed her and said , ‘I have loved you’ .
And then he died .
 
He loved France , Brittany especially , and nature , and he saw God in it ; for that reason you should mourn him as a brother .
In many respects he was your brother , that is why I am telling you about the life of this ‘stranger on the earth’ who nevertheless was one of its true citizens .
Farewell , Sir , think of him sometimes .
I wrote the same letter to Alphonse Karr in Nice , only instead of what follows I put:
‘I believed I ought to tell you this , you , my friend the author of Voyage autour de mon jardin and of Clovis Gosselin , you who loved the poor lady who was with you on the boat from Lyon , you who love Normandy’s cottages , surrounded by apple trees in blossom’ .
To Emile Souvestre .
‘And you , too , love Brittany and the last Bretons’ . That is why I am telling you about the life of this stranger on the earth who nevertheless was one of its true citizens .
 
I loved that unusual and slightly sad town (Granville) , which lives on deep-sea fishing of the most dangerous kind . The family knows that it is fed from the hazards of that lottery , of man’s life and death .
That adds overall a serious note to the wild character of that coast .
I have many times savoured the melancholy of evening , either when walking down to the already darkened beach , or when from the top of the town that crowns the rock , I could see the sun going down on the slightly misty horizon .
Its huge globe , often strongly marked by black and red stripes , would sink , without stopping to create fantasies in the sky , landscapes in light , which often enliven the view elsewhere .
In August , it was already autumn . There was scarcely any dusk . No sooner had the sun set than the wind would grow chill , the waves would run fast , green and dark . There was little to be seen but a few shadowy women in their black capes , lined with white . The sheep straggling on the poor pastures of the slopes that overhang the beach from 80 or 100 feet would make it sad with their plaintive bleating .
Michelet , La mer
And Naomi’s husband died , and she remained .
And Ruth said: Intreat me not to leave thee , in order to take myself from thee , for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest I will lodge . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God . Where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried . May the Lord grant that nothing but death part thee from me .
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem . And all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is not Naomi here? And she replied unto them: Call me not Naomi , call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
I went out full of good things and the LORD hath brought me back empty . Why then call ye me Naomi , since the LORD hath brought me low and and the Almighty hath afflicted me .
How pure her features! Something sour
Yet charming played about her untamed lip ;
She was indeed the daughter of the shore ,
Strong , as if tempered by the exhalations of the sea .
Jules Breton
