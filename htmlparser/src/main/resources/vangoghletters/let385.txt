Letter|Hoogeveen , Tuesday evening .
My dear Theo ,
I’ve just arrived here .
I saw some beautiful bits of the Veluwe region from the train , but by the time we reached these parts everything was dark , so I don’t know what it’s like yet .
Anyway , am sitting in a large taproom like the ones in Brabant , where a woman is sitting peeling potatoes , quite an interesting little figure .
I’ve been talking to people here , and in a day or two I’ll take the barge and travel all the way down the Hoogeveense Vaart through the peat bogs , right across the south-east corner of Drenthe .
Then , northwards from here it seems that there’s magnificent heathland all the way to Assen .
I’m certainly curious , as you can imagine .
Everything went well in The Hague . That came to the station to see me .
The and her were with me until the last minute , of course , and the parting wasn’t very easy when I left . I’ve provided for her as best I could , but she’ll have a difficult time .
I’ve brought very little paint with me , but some anyway , and I hope to be able to get more soon . I found the colour of the Veluwe rich .
 
I hope to await your next letter here , this is a country lodging-house near the station .
Address the letter care of A . Hartsuiker , lodging-house keeper at Hoogeveen .
After that , though , I may go deeper into the countryside , but I’ll wait until I have a little stock of paint .
Well , more soon ; at the moment I haven’t seen anything apart from what I’ve told you , the fields out of the train window and the taproom here , which is nothing out of the ordinary .
In any case I wanted to let you know that I’m here . Regards , I’ll set out tomorrow .
With a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
As soon as you receive this be so good as to pop a postcard or something in the post to see if it arrives all right . Got up early this morning because I was really curious . The weather was marvellous , the air is clear and sparkling , like it is in Brabant .
 
At the lodgings here I saw a barn that’s laid out differently from the ones in Brabant . I may make something of it later , if I stay here , at least .
Well , the fields around here are mostly meadowland , with small trees here and there .
I think I’ve done well in making Hoogeveen my base .
At least it’s nice that I heard on the very first evening that I can go by barge right through the whole peat district as far as the Prussian border and the Zwarte Meer .
I’ll write soon to tell you a lot more about it than today .
I’ll set out on this journey as soon as I have some more paint , and will go from one hamlet or village to another .
However this remains the address , and I’m leaving my things here for the time being , even if I’m away for some time and don’t know myself exactly where I’ll be . I’ve agreed to pay 1 guilder a day here , while I’m here , that is , and between times I can leave my suitcase &amp ; c . in the attic .
 
In the village harbour I saw really authentic peat barges and the figures of bargemen . Women wearing the local costume in the hayfield — fine . It will probably be even more beautiful deeper into the countryside , but meanwhile I’m already seeing very good things — even here .
So write a few words soon . As I said , to the address
 	A . Hartsuiker
 	-house keeper at Hoogeveen
The village or town here is mainly one long row of houses by the harbour , many new houses and a few more beautiful old ones .
