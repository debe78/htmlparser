Letter|My dear Theo ,
I thank Jo very much for writing to me , and knowing that you wish me to write you a line I’m letting you know that it’s very difficult for me to write , so disturbed is my mind . So I’m taking advantage of an interval .
Dr Peyron is really kind to me and really patient . You can imagine that I’m very deeply distressed that the attacks have recurred when I was already beginning to hope that it wouldn’t recur .
You’ll perhaps do well to write a line to Dr Peyron to say that working on my paintings is quite necessary to me for my recovery .
For these days , without anything to do and without being able to go into the room he had allocated me for doing my painting , are almost intolerable to me .
 
I’ve received catalogue of the Gauguin , Bernard , Schuffenecker &amp ; c . exhibition , which I find interesting . G . also wrote me a kind letter , still a little vague and obscure , but anyway I must say that I think they’re quite right to have exhibited among themselves .
For many days I’ve been absolutely distraught , as in Arles , just as much if not worse , and it’s to be presumed that these crises will recur in the future , it is ABOMINABLE . I haven’t been able to eat for 4 days , as my throat is swollen . It’s not in order to complain too much , I hope , if I tell you these details , but to prove to you that I’m not yet in a fit state to go to Paris or to Pont-Aven unless it were to Charenton .
 
It appears that I pick up filthy things and eat them , although my memories of these bad moments are vague , and it appears to me that there’s something shady about it , still for the same reason that they have I don’t know what prejudice against painters here .
I no longer see any possibility for courage or good hope , but anyway it wasn’t yesterday that we found out that this profession isn’t a happy one .
All the same it gives me pleasure that you’ve received that consignment from here , the landscapes . Thank you above all for that etching after Rembrandt . It’s surprising , and yet it makes me think again of the man with the staff in the La Caze gallery . If you want to do me a very , very great pleasure , then
  send a copy of it to Gauguin . Then the Rodin and Claude Monet brochure is really interesting .
This new crisis , my dear brother , came upon me in the fields , and when I was in the middle of painting on a windy day . I’ll send you the canvas , which I nevertheless finished . And it was precisely a more sober attempt , matt in colour without looking impressive , broken greens , reds and rusty ochre yellows , as I told you that from time to time I felt a desire to begin again with a palette like the one in the north .
I’ll send you that canvas as soon as I can . Good-day , thank you for all your kindnesses , good handshake to you and to Jo , and naturally to Cor if he’s still there .
Vincent
Mother and Wil have also written me a very nice letter .
Whilst not liking Rod’s book excessively , I’ve nevertheless done a canvas of that passage in which he speaks of the darkish mountains and huts .
(Our friend Roulin has written to me too . )
