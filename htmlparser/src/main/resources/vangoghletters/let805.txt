Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks very much for your letter . First , it gives me very great pleasure that you , for your part , had also already thought of ère Pissarro .
You’ll see that there are other possibilities , if not there then elsewhere . Now business is business , and you ask me to answer categorically – and you’re right to do so – if I would consent to go into an asylum in Paris in the event of moving immediately for this winter .
I answer yes to that , with the same calmness and for the same reasons as I entered this one – even though this asylum in Paris might not be ideal , which might easily be the case , for the opportunity to work isn’t bad here , and work my only distraction .
But that being said , I’ll point out to you that in my letter I gave a very serious motive as a reason for wishing to move .
And I insist on repeating it – I’m astonished that with the modern ideas I have , I being such an ardent admirer of Zola , of De Goncourt and of artistic things which I feel so much , I have crises like a superstitious person would have , and that mixed-up , atrocious religious ideas come to me such as I never had in my head in the north .
On the assumption that , very sensitive to surroundings , the already prolonged stay in these old cloisters which are the Arles hospital and the home here would be sufficient in itself to explain these crises – then – even as a stopgap – it might be necessary to go into a lay asylum at present .
Nevertheless , to avoid doing or appearing to do anything rash , I declare to you , after having thus warned you of what I might desire at a given moment – that is , a move – I declare to you that I feel sufficiently calm and confident to wait
  a while longer to see if there’ll be a new attack this winter .
But if then I was to write to you: I want to get out of here , you wouldn’t hesitate and it would be arranged in advance , for you would know then that I’d have a serious reason , or even several , to go into a home that wasn’t run like this one by the nuns , however excellent they might be .
Now if by some arrangement or another we might move sooner or later , then let’s begin as if almost nothing was wrong , at the same time being very prudent and ready to listen to the least thing that Rivet has to say , but let’s not set ourselves immediately to taking overly official measures as if it were a lost cause .
As regards eating a lot , I’m doing so – but if I was my doctor I would forbid it .
Not seeing any good for myself in really enormous physical strength , for if I absorb myself in the idea of doing some good work and wanting to be an artist and nothing but that , that would be the most logical thing .
Mother and Wil , each for their part after Cor’s departure , have changed surroundings – they were darned right . Grief mustn’t build up in our souls like the water of a swamp . But it’s sometimes both costly and impossible to move .
Wil wrote very well , it’s a great grief for them , Cor’s departure .
It’s funny , just at the moment when I was making that copy of the Pietà by Delacroix I discovered where that canvas has gone . It belongs to a queen of Hungary or another country around there who has written poems under the name of Carmen Sylva . The article which talked of her and of the painting was by Pierre Loti , who made one feel that this Carmen Sylva was as a person yet more touching than what she writes – and yet she
  writes things like this: A woman without a child is like a bell without a clapper – the sound of the bronze would perhaps be very beautiful , but no one will hear it .
At present I have 7 copies out of ten of Millet’s Travaux des champs .
I can assure you that it interests me enormously to make copies , and that not having any models for the moment it will ensure , however , that I don’t lose sight of the figure .
What’s more , it will give me a studio decoration for myself or another .
I would like also to copy the Sower and the Diggers .
There’s a photo of the Diggers after the drawing .
And Lerat’s etching of the Sower at Durand-Ruel’s .
In these same etchings is the Field under the snow with a harrow . Then The four times of the day , there are examples of them in the collection of wood engravings .
I would like to have all of this , at least the etchings and the wood engravings . It’s a study I need , for I want to learn . Although copying may be the old system , that absolutely doesn’t bother me at all . I’m going to copy Delacroix’s Good Samaritan too .
I’ve done a portrait of a – the orderly’s wife – which I think you’d like . I’ve done a repetition of it which wasn’t as good as the one from life .
And I fear that they’ll take the latter , I would have liked you to have it . It’s pink and black .
Today I’m sending you my portrait of myself , you must look at it for some time – you’ll see , I hope , that my physiognomy has grown much calmer , although the gaze may be vaguer than before , so it appears to me .
 
I have another one which is an attempt from when I was ill . But I think this one will please you more , and I’ve tried to create something simple , show it to ère Pissarro if you see him .
You’ll be surprised what effect the Travaux des champs take on in colour , it’s a very intimate series of his .
What I’m seeking in it , and why it seems good to me to copy them , I’m going to try to tell you . We painters are always asked to compose ourselves and to be nothing but composers .
Very well – but in music it isn’t so – and if such a person plays some Beethoven he’ll add his personal interpretation to it – in music , and then above all for singing – a composer’s interpretation is something , and it isn’t a hard and fast rule that only the composer plays his own compositions .
Good – since I’m above all ill at present , I’m trying to do something to console myself , for my own pleasure .
I place the black-and-white by Delacroix or Millet or after them in front of me as a subject . And then I improvise colour on it but , being me , not completely of course , but seeking memories of their paintings – but the memory , the vague consonance of colours that are in the same sentiment , if not right – that’s my own interpretation .
Heaps of people don’t copy . Heaps of others do copy – for me , I set myself to it by chance , and I find that it teaches and above all sometimes consoles .
So then my brush goes between my fingers as if it were a bow on the violin and absolutely for my pleasure . Today I attempted the Sheep shearer in a colour scale ranging from lilac to yellow . They are small canvases , around no . 5 .
 
I thank you very much for the consignment of canvases and colours . On the other hand , I’m sending you a few canvases with the portrait , the following
Moonrise (wheatsheaves)
Study fields
, ,
olive trees
Night study
The mountain
Field of green wheat
Olive trees
Orchard in blossom
Entrance to a quarry
The first four canvases are studies that don’t have the effect of an ensemble like the others . Myself I quite like the Entrance to a quarry which I did when I felt this attack beginning , because to my taste the dark greens go well with the ochre tones , there’s something sad in them that’s healthy , and that’s why it doesn’t annoy me . That’s perhaps also the case with the Mountain . People will tell me that mountains aren’t like that , and that there are black contours as wide as a finger . But anyway it seemed to me that it expressed the passage in Rod’s book – one of the very rare passages of his in which I find something good – on a lost land of dark mountains in which one noticed the darkish huts of goatherds , where sunflowers bloomed .
The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains , as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect –
These are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement , their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts . The olive trees are more in character , just as in the other study and I’ve tried to express the time of day when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat .
The other canvases – the Reaper &amp ; c . aren’t dry . And now in the bad season I’m going to make a lot of copies , for really I must do more figure work . It’s the study of the figure that teaches one to grasp the essential and to simplify .
 
When you say in your letter that I’ve never done anything but work , no – that’s not right – I myself am very , very discontented with my work , and the only thing that consoles me is that experienced people say that one must paint for 10 years for nothing . But what I’ve done is only those 10 years of unfortunate studies that didn’t come off . Now a better period could come , but I’ll have to strengthen the figure work , and I must refresh my memory by very close study of Delacroix , Millet . Then I’ll try to sort out my drawing . Yes , every cloud has a silver lining , it gives one more time for study .
I’m also adding a study of flowers to the roll of canvases – not much , but anyway I don’t want to tear it up .
All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield , the Mountain , the Orchard , the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry , and the rest says nothing to me , because it lacks personal will , feeling in the lines . Where these lines are close together and deliberate the painting begins , even if it may be exaggerated . That’s what Bernard and Gauguin feel a little bit , they won’t ask for the correct shape of a tree at all , but they absolutely insist that one says if the shape is round or square – and my word , they’re right –
Exasperated by certain people’s photographic and inane perfection . They won’t ask for the correct tone of the mountains but they’ll say: for Christ’s sake , were the mountains blue , then chuck on some blue and don’t go telling me that it was a blue a bit like this or like that , it was blue wasn’t it? Good – make them blue and that’s enough! Gauguin is a genius sometimes when he explains that , but as for the genius Gauguin has , he’s very timid about showing it , and it’s touching how he likes to say something really useful to young folk . What an odd fellow all the same .
 
It gives me great pleasure that Jo is well , and I think you’ll feel much more in your element thinking of her pregnancy , and naturally having concerns about it too , than if you were alone without these family concerns . For you’ll feel more in nature .
When one thinks of Millet and Delacroix , what a contrast . Delacroix without a wife , without children , Millet completely in his family , more than anyone .
And yet what similarities there are in their work .
So Jouve has still kept his big studio and he’s working on decorations .
That one came very close to being an excellent painter . It’s money troubles with him , in order to eat he’s forced to do a thousand things other than painting , which costs him more money than it brings in when he makes something beautiful .
And he quickly loses his touch for drawing with the brush . This probably comes from the old training method , which is the same as the current one – in the studios – they fill in outlines . And Daumier was always painting his face in the mirror to learn how to draw!
Do you know what I think about quite often – what I used to say to you back in the old days , that if I didn’t succeed I still thought that what I had worked on would be continued . Not directly , but one isn’t alone in believing things that are true . And what does one matter as a person then? I feel so strongly that the story of people is like the story of wheat , if one isn’t sown in the earth to germinate there , what does it matter , one is milled in order to become bread .
The difference between happiness and unhappiness , both are necessary and useful , and death or passing away . . . it’s so relative – and so is life .
 
Even in the face of an illness that’s unsettling or worrying , this belief is absolutely unshaken .
I’d have liked to see those Meunier .
Well , let it be understood that if I were to write to you again expressly and briefly that I wanted to come to Paris , I would have a reason for that , which I’ve explained above , that in the meantime there’s no great hurry , and I’m quite confident , after warning you , to wait for the winter and the crisis which may recur then . But if I have another fit of religious exaltation , then no delay , I’d like to leave immediately without giving a reason . Only we have no right , at least it would be indiscreet , to meddle in the nuns’ management or even to criticize them . They have their own belief and ways of doing good to others , sometimes it works very well . But I don’t warn you lightly . And it isn’t to regain more freedom or something else that I don’t have . So let’s wait very calmly until an opportunity presents itself to find a place .
It’s a great advance that my stomach is working well , and so I don’t think that I’ll be as sensitive to the cold . Then I know what to do when the weather is bad , as I have this plan to copy several things that I like .
I’d very much like to see Millet reproductions in schools , I think there would be children who became painters if only they saw good things .
Give my warm regards to Jo , and handshake , more soon .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
