Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks very much for your last letter , I’m very glad that you and Jo are in good health , and very often think of you both .
It’s very interesting what you tell me about a publication of coloured lithographs with a text on Monticelli , honestly , that gives me very great pleasure , and I’d be very curious to see them one day . I hope that he’ll reproduce in colour the bouquet you have , for that’s a thing of the first order as regards colour . One day I’d very much like to do a print or two myself in this vein after my canvases . Thus I’m working on a painting at the moment , women picking olives , which would lend itself to it , I think . These are the colours: the field is violet and further away yellow ochre , the olive trees with bronze trunks have grey-green foliage , the sky is entirely pink , and 3 small figures pink also . The whole in a very discreet range . It’s a canvas I’m working on from memory after the study of the same size done on the spot , because I want a far-off thing like a vague memory softened by time . There are only two notes , pink and green , which harmonize , neutralize each other , oppose each other . I’ll probably do 2 or three repetitions of it , for in fact it’s the result of a half-dozen studies of olive trees .
I think it likely that I’ll do hardly any more things in impasto , it’s the result of the calm life of seclusion I’m leading , and I feel I’m better for it . Fundamentally I’m not as violent as that , anyway I feel more myself in calmness .
You’ll perhaps also see it in the canvas for the Vingtistes that I sent yesterday , the Wheatfield with rising sun . You’ll receive the Bedroom at the same time . I’ve also added two drawings to them . I’m curious to know what you’ll say about the Wheatfield , you may have to look at it for a while perhaps . However , I hope that you’ll write to me soon whether it’s arrived in good order if you find a free half hour next week .
 
I’d be completely resigned to staying here next year too , because I think the work will get along a little . And through the prolonged stay , I feel the country here differently from the first place encountered – good ideas are now germinating a little and should be allowed to develop . And thus I wouldn’t be so very far removed from the idea of going to look for something in the land of Tartarin . I have a great desire to do more of both the cypresses and the Alpilles , and often going on long walks in all directions I’ve noted many subjects and know good places for when the fine days come . Then , from the point of view of expenditure there would hardly be any advantage in moving I think , and moving makes the success of the work all the more doubtful . I’ve received another very nice letter from Gauguin , a letter thoroughly impregnated with the proximity of the sea , I think he must be doing fine , rather savage things .
You tell me not to give myself too many worries and that better days will come again for me . I’d say that these better days have already begun for myself , when I glimpse the possibility of completing , to some extent , the work in such a way that you’ll have a series of Provençal studies done with feeling which will hold up , this is what I hope , with our far-off memories of youth in Holland , and thus I’m treating myself by redoing the olive trees again for our and . And if I could one day prove that I wouldn’t impoverish the family , that would relieve me . For at present I always have a great deal of remorse in spending money that doesn’t come back . But as you say , patience and working is the only chance of getting out of that .
However , I often tell myself that if I’d done like you , if I’d stayed at the Goupils’ , if I’d restricted myself to selling paintings , I would have done better . For in the trade , if one doesn’t produce oneself one makes others produce , now that so many artists need support among the dealers and only rarely find it .
 
The money that was with Mr Peyron has run out , and a few days ago he even gave me 10 francs in advance . And in the course of the month I’ll certainly need another ten , and at New Year I’d consider it right to give something to the servant lads who work here , and to the porter , which will make another ten francs or so .
As regards winter clothing , what I have isn’t very much , as you’ll understand , but it’s warm enough and so we can wait until spring with that . If I go out it’s to work , so then I put on the most worn-out things I have , and I have a velvet waistcoat and trousers for here . In the spring , if I’m here , I’m planning to go and make a few paintings in Arles as well , and if I get something new around then , that will suffice .
I’m sending you enclosed an order for canvas and colours , but I still have some and it can wait until next month if this one is too heavily burdened already .
I remember the painting by Manet you speak of . As to figure , the portrait of a man by Puvis de Chavannes has always remained an ideal for me , an old man reading a yellow novel , with beside him a rose and watercolour brushes in a glass of water – and the portrait of a lady that he had in the same exhibition , a woman already old but completely as Michelet felt , that there’s no such thing as an old woman . These are consolatory things , to see modern life as bright despite its inevitable sadnesses .
Last year around this time I was certainly not thinking that I would recover as much as this .
 
Give my kind regards to Isaäcson if you see him , and to Bernard .
I regret not being able to send the olive trees one of these days , but it’s drying so badly that I’ll have to wait .
I think it’ll be a good course of action to have our come in January . Ah , if that one could get married , that would be a good thing .
I shake your hand warmly in thought , I’m going to work some more outside , the mistral’s blowing . It usually dies down by the time the sun’s about to set , then there are superb effects of pale citron skies , and desolate pines cast their silhouettes into relief against it with effects of exquisite black lace .
At other times the sky is red , at other times a tone that’s extremely delicate , neutral , still pale lemon but neutralized by delicate lilac .
I have an evening effect of a pine again against pink and green-yellow . Anyway , shortly you’ll see these canvases , of which the first , the Wheatfield , has just left . More soon , I hope , warm regards to Jo .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
