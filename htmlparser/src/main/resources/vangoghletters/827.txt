Letter|My dear ,
Thanks very much for writing to me . Myself , I’d be very pleased if you went to Theo’s in January – as it isn’t impossible that I too may go to Paris , we may meet . The description of your and Mother’s new dwelling interests me a great deal , and this move is indeed a wise and well-considered arrangement . It would certainly charm me if I saw it , this quay where people come to wash green and red wool with the small barges and vessels moored , and the factory with its windows lit up in the evening . Those are effects that I would paint .
And the garden too , with its espalier mulberry tree . As regards mulberry trees , there are a lot here . I painted one not long ago when its bushy foliage was a magnificent yellow against a very blue sky and a white , stony , sunlit field behind .
I’m planning to send to Brussels sunflowers , a completely red vineyard in the autumn , an orchard in blossom , tree-trunks covered with ivy , and finally a field of young wheat in the rising sun . I’m working on this last canvas at the moment , it is (with the orchard in blossom , which Theo liked , from what he was saying) the gentlest thing I’ve painted . The fleeing lines of the furrows rise high into the canvas towards a background of purplish hills . The earth is pink and violet marbled with the yellow-green of the wheat . The sky in the background with a sun is pale lemon yellow and pink .
Above all , don’t imagine that it’s less cold here than in Holland , the winter has only just begun and we’ll have it until the end of March . Only less rain than in Holland , very cold , unbearably irritating wind , and cold spells that are dry and bright but severe all the same , although the sun has more strength and the sky is very blue .
 
You will receive soon , I think , the canvases I promised you . What I find very unfortunate is that you write that Jo says that Theo’s still coughing the whole time – blast – that doesn’t please me – however , I still hope that when he’s a father it’ll get better . I’d like him to have my health , in this sense that I myself always have lots of life in the fresh air , and he’s always always at his desk with so many troubles on his mind .
And they’re wicked at Boussods’ , too full of pride and tyrannical .
I have 12 large canvases on the go , above all olive groves , one with an entirely pink sky , another with a green and orange sky , a third with a big yellow sun .
Then tall , ravaged pines against a red sunset sky . I’ve just received a very kind letter from Theo , he says that Jo and he are well , and he also says that you’ll perhaps come to them . Let’s keep hoping that in a while his health will completely recover – with him , the state of his mind greatly influences the rest . At the moment many painters who spent the winter in the countryside are returning to Paris . You ask who Bernard is – he’s a young painter – he’s twenty at most . Very original . He seeks to do modern figures as elegant as ancient Greeks or Egyptians . A grace in the expressive movements , a charm through daring colours . I saw a Sunday afternoon in Brittany by him
  , Breton peasant women , peasants , dogs strolling in a very green meadow , the costumes are black and red , and big white caps .
But in this crowd there are also two ladies , one in red , the other in bottle green , who make it into a really modern thing .
Ask Theo to show you the watercolour I did after the painting , it was so original that I wanted to have a copy of it .
Now you think you remember having seen some rocks by him , he’s done a lot of them , and cliffs and beaches in Brittany .
He’s also done landscapes and figures of the Paris suburbs . Theo has an excellent thing of his which I exchanged with Bernard for a canvas of mine . It’s the portrait of his very old grandmother , one-eyed , the background is a bedroom wall covered with chocolate-coloured wallpaper , and a completely white bed .
He’s just sent me 6 photographs of paintings he’s done this year , and by contrast they are bizarre biblical subjects and very open to criticism . But you can see from this that he’s a curious fellow , a seeker who tries everything . It’s like tapestries from the Middle Ages: stiff , brightly coloured figures . But I have only a mediocre admiration for this , because the English Pre-Raphaelites did those things with more seriousness and conscientiousness and knowledge and logic . Thus you may know Millais who did The Huguenot and an engraving , The light of the world . If you wanted I could tell Bernard to do your portrait when you’re in Paris , he’d certainly do it , and very well I can assure you , I wouldn’t speak to him about it if it would displease you , but I myself would very much like him to do it . And I would exchange it for a painting of mine he wants me to exchange .
 
While writing this letter I got to my feet to go and give a few brushstrokes to a canvas in progress – specifically , it’s the one with the ravaged pines against a red , orange , yellow sky – yesterday it was very fresh – pure , dazzling tones – well while writing to you I don’t know what thoughts came to me , and upon looking at my canvas I told myself , that’s not it . So I took a colour that appears as matt , dirty white on the palette , which one obtains by mixing white , green and a little carmine , I slashed this green tone all over the sky , and there you are , from a distance it softens the tones by breaking them up . And yet it would seem that one spoils and dirties the canvas . Do misfortune and sickness not do this with us and our health , and are we not worth more just as we are , in fate , the great destiny that carries us away , than serene and well according to our own vague ideas and desires of possible happiness? I don’t know .
Some of my paintings , when I compare them to others , certainly do bear the trace that it’s a sick man who paints them , and I can assure you that I don’t do it deliberately . But despite myself , my calculations end up at broken tones . Bernard has who grudgingly house and feed him , often reproaching him for still not earning money . So the house there is sometimes a hell , but no one works so much with so few expenses to my knowledge . Anyway he’s a fine , really Parisian boy , very elegant . He was to go off to be a soldier this year , but for health reasons it has been postponed to next year .
I must go and work some more , more soon , I kiss you affectionately in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
