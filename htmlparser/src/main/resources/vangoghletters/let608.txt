Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve written to you in Brussels again to tell you that I hoped you’d be in a position to send me some more money , when you get back to Paris at the latest . Because in order to recover possession of my trunk , I had to pay the whole bill for the time being , while at the same time having got it stated on the receipt that this inflated bill would be verified before the justice of the peace . I’m not sure about winning , although I am absolutely entitled to a deduction of 27 francs and no compensation for all the trouble it’s causing me .
First I had an absolutely consuming period of work and then I was so worn out and ill that I didn’t feel I had the strength to go and live on my own — and I’ve put up with things too much , for their present bill they’re basing themselves on a period when I was paying them more (when I was ill and had asked them for better wine) .
But all in all , it’s so much the better that all of that has now forced me to take this decision .
 
In short , I believe I’m a worker and not a soft foreign tourist here to enjoy himself , and it would be lack of energy on my part to let myself be exploited like that . So I’m starting to set up a studio that may at the same time be of use to our pals , if they come , or if there are painters here .
In the crate you’ll first of all find the paintings I did for Jet Mauve and Tersteeg . If in the meantime you should foresee that Tersteeg would take offence at it , well , in a word , if it’s better that I don’t talk to him , then you’ll keep it and you can scrape off the dedication and we’ll exchange it with a pal . As for the repetitions of these two studies , I thought the bridge was better than Tersteeg’s but Jet Mauve’s study is simpler than the repetition . Perhaps as it ages this repetition will improve , I worked on it a lot .
  Then the series of orchards — I think the white orchard of which I sent you pen drawing and the largest of all in pink and green on absorbent canvas are the best . A large study without a stretching frame and another on a stretching frame in which there’s a lot of stippling are unfinished , which I regret because the composition gave an overall idea of the large orchards surrounded by cypresses around here . Well , I’ve already written and told you what I thought of them . And you’ll have them soon , since the crate goes off this evening .
Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
I think for the frames — the two yellow bridges with blue sky will do well in the dark blue they call royal blue , the white orchard in cold white , the large pink orchard in slightly warm cream .
