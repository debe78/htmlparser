Letter|My dear Theo —
At last I’m sending you a little croquis to give you at least an idea of the direction the work is taking . Because today I’ve gone back to it .
My eyes are still tired , but anyway I had a new idea in mind , and here’s the croquis of it . No . 30 canvas once again .
This time it’s simply my bedroom , but the colour has to do the job here , and through its being simplified by giving a grander style to things , to be suggestive here of rest or of sleep in general . In short , looking at the painting should rest the mind , or rather , the imagination .
The walls are of a pale violet . The floor — is of red tiles .
The bedstead and the chairs are fresh butter yellow .
The sheet and the pillows very bright lemon green .
The bedspread scarlet red .
The window green .
The dressing table orange , the basin blue .
The doors lilac .
And that’s all — nothing in this bedroom , with its shutters closed .
The solidity of the furniture should also now express unshakeable repose .
Portraits on the wall , and a mirror and a hand-towel and some clothes .
The frame — as there’s no white in the painting — will be white .
This to take my revenge for the enforced rest that I was obliged to take .
I’ll work on it again all day tomorrow , but you can see how simple the idea is . The shadows and cast shadows are removed ; it’s coloured in flat , plain tints like Japanese prints .
It will contrast , for example , with the Tarascon diligence and the night café .
 
I won’t write to you at length , because I’m going to start very early tomorrow with the fresh morning light , to finish my canvas .
How are your pains? Don’t forget to give me news about them .
I hope you’ll write in the next few days .
One day I’ll do you some croquis of the other rooms as well .
I shake your hand firmly .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
