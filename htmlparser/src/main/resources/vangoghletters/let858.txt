Letter|Paris , 19 March 1890
My dear Vincent ,
We were really pleased to receive your last letter , but we’re sorry from the bottom of our hearts that you can’t give us better news . You’ll need an enormous amount of patience to overcome the trouble your condition must cause you . However , there’s a tendency to improvement , which we must begin by being extremely glad about . The cold weather always has an influence on you , and so it’s possible that milder weather will cure you entirely ,
  let’s hope so , and don’t tire yourself out too much .
How pleased I would have been if you’d been there at the Independents’ exhibition . It was the day of the private viewing when Carnot came . I was there with Jo . Your paintings are well placed and look very well . Many people came up to ask me to give you their compliments . Gauguin said that your paintings are the key to the exhibition . He suggests an exchange of one of his canvases for the one of the Alpilles . I told him that I didn’t think you’d have any objection , on the contrary that it would please you that he likes your painting . I also like it very much , that painting , and it looks admirably well in the exhibition .
Seurat exhibited a most curious painting there , searching to express
  things through the direction of the line . Certainly he expresses movement , but it has a most curious appearance and not very generous as regards ideas . Guillaumin is exhibiting several things , some very good ones among them , De Lautrec has an excellent portrait of a woman at the piano , and a large painting which holds its own very well . There’s a great distinction in it , despite the risqué subject . In general it’s noticeable that the public is beginning to be more and more interested in the young Impressionists , there are at least a certain number of art lovers who are beginning to buy them . The Pissarro exhibition is over , lots of people came , and 5 were sold . For the moment that’s all we were hoping for . Next Sunday Bernard and Aurier are to come and see your latest
  canvases . Bernard has been a bit ill but is feeling better . Enclosed with this you’ll find a letter from Aurier . He’s to come shortly to see the Gauguin and do an article on him . I’ve received the money for your painting from Brussels , and Maus writes to me: ‘When you have an opportunity please tell your brother that I was very happy that he participated in the Salon of Les Vingt where , in the melée of discussions , he found lively artistic sympathies’ . Do you want me to send you the money? I’m holding it for you for whenever you want it . I hope , my dear brother , that you can soon give us more satisfactory news of your health . You’d feel happier if you saw your little godson . Try to find out from Dr Peyron if he sees no danger in your coming to Paris when you’ve recovered from this crisis . Jo sends you her warm regards , and joins with me in sending best wishes for your speedy recovery .
Good handshake .
Theo
