Letter|My dear Theo ,
It has surprised me a little not to have received even a single word from you . You’ll say you’ve been too busy to think about it — and I can very well understand that .
It’s already late — but I wanted to tell you once more that I whole-heartedly hope that from now on the correspondence will again become livelier than it has been recently .
Herewith two scratches after a couple of studies that I made , while at the same time I’m working on those peasants around a dish of potatoes again .
I’ve just come home from there — and have worked on it further by lamplight — although this time I started it in daylight .
See , this is what the composition has now become . I’ve painted it on a fairly large canvas , and as the sketch is now , I believe there’s life in it .
 
But I know for certain that C . M . , for instance , would speak of — badly drawn &amp ; c .
Do you know what can definitely be said to counter that? That the beautiful effects of the light in nature require one to work very fast . Now I know very well that the great masters were able both to finish and to maintain the vitality , particularly in the period of their mature experience .
But that’s something I certainly won’t be able to do like that for the time being .
At the point where I now am , though , I see a chance of giving a felt impression of what I see .
Not always literally exactly — rather never exactly — for one sees nature through one’s own temperament .
What I’d like to advise now is the following: don’t let the time slip by — let me work as much as is in any way possible — and keep all the studies from now on yourself . I’d rather not sign any of them yet , though , because I wouldn’t like to have them circulating like paintings , so that one would have to buy them back later should one make something of a name .
But it’s good that you’re showing them , because you’ll see that some day we’ll find someone who wants to do what I’m suggesting to you , that is , make a collection of studies .
 
I mean to go out regularly in the mornings and just tackle whatever I see the people doing in the fields or at home . As I do now anyway .
You’re looking for new ideas for the art trade ; the idea of being fair to the art lovers isn’t new , but it’s one that never grows old . So , too , giving security — on a purchase . And I ask you , isn’t an art lover better off when he has , say , 20 very diverse sketches by a painter for the same price that he would reasonably have to pay for one painting that was finished so that it could be put into circulation as a saleable commodity? If I were in your position , because after all you know a lot of young painters who haven’t yet made a name , I’d just try once to put painted studies on the market proper — not as paintings , but mounted somehow or other , on gilt Bristol , say , or black or dark red .
But I spoke there about giving security .
Not all painters make a lot of studies — but many do , and the young ones in particular have to do it as much as possible , don’t they? Anyone who owns a painter’s studies can be as good as certain (at least so it seems to me) that there’s a bond between the painter and him that can’t easily be broken just on a whim .
 
There are people , aren’t there , who support painters during the time when they aren’t yet earning — very well .
But how often does it happen that such a thing ends badly — unpleasantly for both parties? On the one hand because the patron is dissatisfied about money that’s wholly wasted , or at least seems to be . On the other hand because the painter feels entitled to ask for more trust , more patience and interest than people are prepared to give . But in most cases it’s carelessness on both sides that gives rise to the misunderstandings . I hope that this won’t be the case between us . And I hope that gradually my studies will give you some new courage . Neither you nor I are contemporaries of that generation that Gigoux rightly calls ‘the valiant ones’ in that book of yours that I read .
But maintaining the enthusiasm of those days at this time is nonetheless advisable , it seems to me , because it’s often true that fortune favours the bold , and be this as it may — about fortune or ‘la joie (?) de vivre’ , that is — one must work and be bold if one really wants to live . And I say , let’s paint a lot and be productive , and be ourselves with faults and qualities — I say us — because the money from you that I know causes you trouble enough to provide for me , gives you the right , if anything good happens in my work , to consider half of it as your own creation .
Try to talk to someone at Le Chat Noir and ask them whether they want a scratch of those potato eaters and , if so , what size , because it makes no difference to me .
Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
