Letter|23 November 1881
My dear Rappard ,
When I re-read your letters , old chap , I find such good , nice remarks in them , and , you see , that’s precisely what spurs me on to keep up this correspondence .
Aha! So I’m actually a headstrong person after all! Well , I’ll admit defeat , you’ve stung me to the quick! So be it . I thank you for that revelation , yes , thank God , at first I didn’t dare believe it myself but you’ve made it clear to me , so I have a will , an inclination , I’m going in a definite direction , and , what’s more , not satisfied with that , I want others to go with me! Thank God , so I’m a headstrong person! Well , from now on I want to be nothing else . And now I’d really like to have my friend Rappard as my travelling companion – it’s not a matter of indifference to me to lose sight of him – am I wrong about that?
Well , I was saying , in my haste , that I wanted to drive people ‘to the open sea’ (see previous letter) . If that’s all I did I would be a terrible barbarian . But there’s something else that makes the matter more reasonable . A man can’t stand it on the open sea for long – he has to have a little hut on the beach with a fire on the hearth – with a wife and children around that hearth .
You see , Rappard , where I myself seek to go , whither I seek to push others as well , is to become fishermen in the sea that we call the ocean of reality , but for myself , and for those fellow human beings I sometimes buttonhole , I definitely want ‘that little hut’ as well . And in that little hut the above-mentioned things . So the sea and that haven , or that haven and the sea .
And as regards that doctrine I’m preaching . That tenet of mine , ‘people , let us love what we love’ , is based on an axiom . I thought it unnecessary to mention that axiom , but now for the sake of clarity I’ll spell it out . That axiom is ‘People , we love’ . From that I derive the first proposition .
People , let us love what we love , let us be ourselves , ‘let us not want to know better than God’ . (‘Let us not want to know better than God’ is not an expression of mine but of Mauve’s . )
  And I’ll prove that proposition with a reductio ad absurdum , namely in this way . To begin with , suppose a man didn’t love what he loved , how much misery he would cause himself and others , and how much trouble he would stir up in the world of our blessed Lord . In short , if everyone were like that person of whom we assume for the moment — if it’s possible for us to do so , that is — that he didn’t love what he loved , how the world would gradually (which in my view was ordained uprightly by our blessed Lord , and is maintained in that position by Him , and for the time being , for at least as long as you and I shall live , will stay in that position , it will no doubt last out our time) , if , I say , everyone were like that supposed man , intentionally standing upside down and turned inside out (it’s fortunate that he can exist only in our imagination as an abstraction in our reductio ad absurdum of an ungeometric proposition!) , how the world rightly created by God would start to look very like a totally wrong world . It seems to me , starting off with that as an abstraction , that the person in question , intentionally standing upside down and turned inside out , existing for the moment only in our imagination (and not even that) , who wouldn’t choose to love what he loved , we feel to be going so much ‘against the grain’ that we may in fact take as proved the logic or the reasonableness of the proposition ‘people , let us love what we love’ . (Moreover , if I haven’t proved clearly enough that the falseness of the proposition in question is a great absurdity , you , who are much further along in geometry than I am , would — with a bit of good will — easily succeed in finding more conclusive proof of my proposition . )
We now come to remarkable conclusions or ‘consequences’ of this basic principle , which include ,
First , a man who flatly refuses to love what he loves drives himself into the ground .
Second , he’d have to have a very strong dose of O/Abstinence (the O and the A are both applicable , coincidentally . Eh!) to stand it for long .
Third , if he were to change , his conversion wouldn’t be great .
 
Yes , and whether I say it or don’t say it , I think you’ll understand in any case that I’m more or less insinuating: Rappard , that by sticking so close to the academy you’re keeping a spare turn of rope around your arm with which many a man has ‘hanged’ himself – because he couldn’t be free of it when he wanted to choose the sea!
Because you , though , have rather strong muscles , you will be able to break that spare turn of rope in time of need . But others! Believe me , there are those who hang themselves with it!
Are there , in addition to ‘academic’ ones , yet other ‘turns of rope’? There are , by your leave , as many kinds of turns of rope as there are eye beams . (See chapter on ‘eye beams’ in previous letter . )
How many? ‘Legion’ , I say , ‘Legion’ .
‘Hanging oneself’ by the ‘spare turn of rope’ is a much more protracted and fearful death than hanging oneself straightforwardly with a noose .
Are there also moral turns of rope?
And why shouldn’t they be just as good as moral eye beams? But you and I haven’t really laboured under them , nor do we labour under them , nor shall we labour under them .
Hmm — I’m not so very sure of that , and if instead of speaking of you and me I were speaking of myself alone , I’d say: as far as I’m concerned , I have laboured under , am labouring under , shall continue to labour under moral eye beams and moral turns of rope , but that did not , does not and will not alter the fact that I have cast out , am casting out and shall continue to cast out moral eye beams from my eye . And moral turns of rope I have rent asunder , am rending asunder and shall continue to rend asunder with flashes of lightning .
Until at the end I’ll stand with a single eye and a free arm . When?
Provided I persevere until the end – in the end .
 
Well , you will indeed see that together we’ll win this by persevering with our correspondence , that this correspondence will gradually become more serious .
Because although , as I’ve already said , I’m giving free rein to my imagination , I’m nevertheless writing to you truly , not without but very much with earnestness . And , while far from writing to you out of any desire to argue , my intention nonetheless is: ‘to wake Rappard up’ , and I doubt whether in that ‘waking of Rappard’ I’ll nod off myself . God forbid that such would be the case , far from it .
I told you on a previous occasion that I generally scrutinize , with artists in particular , the man who produces the work just as much as the work itself . Lacking the man , I must sometimes draw conclusions from the work alone (we can’t know all artists personally) , lacking the work , I must take the measure of the man alone . Well , of a certain Mr van Rappard I know , first , his work to some extent , second , him to some extent .
His work always says to me , hereafter better .
His person says the same .
From good to better .
Do you think that a very unmerciful judgement? Now (turning to a completely different subject) , as regards my special ‘bête noire’ , I’ve had little opportunity today to occupy myself with pursuit of the same ; even so , I couldn’t refrain from attacking it just for a bit .
But we’ll discuss this in more detail at some point . It’s beginning , however , to be slightly on the qui vive , the fact is that resignation is accustomed to resignation and , I thought , it would give up the fight , but you see , I’m not inclined to do it yet . Anyway , perhaps I’ll tell you later about the bête noire in question . Bloody bête noire! It does me good all the same .
Meanwhile , believe me , with a handshake ,
Ever yours ,
Vincent
I’m now writing to you often because I’ll soon have a lot of other correspondence .
