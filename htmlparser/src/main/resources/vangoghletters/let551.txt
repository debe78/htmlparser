Letter|My dear Theo ,
It’s already late , but I don’t want to put off reporting the safe receipt of your letter and 150 francs .
Before I forget — let me begin by replying to your recent question about the painting by Franck or Francken in St Andrew’s . Which I saw today . I think it a good painting — above all fine in sentiment — in sentiment it’s not very Flemish or Rubenesque . One thinks more of Murillo . The colour is warm , in a reddish spectrum as Jordaens sometimes is . The shadows in the flesh are very powerful , Rubens doesn’t have that and Jordaens often does , and in consequence there’s something mysterious in the painting that one can appreciate in that school .
I couldn’t get near enough to examine the technique from very close to , which would have been worthwhile . The head of Christ is less conventional than the Flemish painters usually conceive it . I imagine , though , that I can do it like that too , and the painting didn’t tell me anything new .
And since I’m not content with what I can do now and am trying to move forward in my work — enough — and move on to other paintings . What did strike me in that church was a sketch by Van Dyck? or Rubens? — a Descent from the Cross that was hanging high up but appeared to me to be good , a lot of sentiment in the pale body . This in passing .
There’s a stained-glass window that I find superb — very , very remarkable . A shore , a green sea with a castle on the rocks , a sparkling blue sky in the most magnificent tones of blue , greenish , whitish , deeper , higher in tone . A huge three-master , whimsical and fantastic , silhouetted against the sky , breaking everywhere , light in the dark , dark in the light .
In the blue a figure of the Blessed Virgin , bright yellow , white , orange . Higher up again , the window is dark green with black , with glowing red . Anyway — do you remember it? It’s very fine and Leys would certainly have fallen in love with it , or James Tissot in his old manner , or Thijs Maris .
I saw a few paintings bought for the Musée Moderne , Verhas and Farasyn . Verhas , ladies riding on donkeys and fisher boys on the beach . Farasyn , a large thing of the old Antwerp Fish Market .
Also an Emile Wauters — Cairo or somewhere , a marketplace . The Verhas works well , is a clever painting , in any event daring , with colours in a light spectrum , several fine combinations , including a figure in orange against light blue , light green and white .
 
I’m still working on my portraits — and at last I’ve got two that are definitely ‘like’ , a profile and a 3/4 That’s not everything , that’s not even the most important thing . All the same , it’s worth my while to seek it , and perhaps it helps one learn how to draw . Besides , I’m beginning to like portraits more and more .
There you have some very famous Rubens — Virgin with the parrot , Christ on the straw &amp ; c . , but for my part I walk past them to look rather at that bold portrait of a man — painted with such a tremendously firm hand — still sketchy here and there — that hangs not far from the Saskia by Rembrandt . In a Descent from the Cross by Van Dyck , the one high up , the big one — there’s also a portrait , definitely a portrait — not just of a head but , thank God , of a whole figure . Superb — in yellow and lilacish — a woman , bending forward , who is weeping . The torso , the legs beneath the clothes really intimately executed and felt . What high art it is , when art is simply true .
And an Ingres , a David , painters who really don’t always paint beautifully , how tremendously interesting even they become when , putting their pedantry aside , they forget themselves in — being true — in capturing a character — like in the two heads in the Musée Moderne . Anyway .
Oh , if only one could get the models that one wanted!!!
Now tell me — supposing first and foremost that you want to be a financier — and I have nothing against that , in fact I even highly approve of it — are you entirely happy with your own reasoning , when you say to me at the beginning of the year , to my disappointment: I have a very great deal to pay and you’ll just have to see that you manage until the end of the month?
Listen , this is what I have to say against it , and just think about whether or not I’m right , at any rate that there are grounds for my reasoning: Am I less than your creditors?
Who should wait , they or I??? if one of the two has to wait , which is in the nature of human things .
 
A creditor is not a friend , that’s for sure , and , in case you don’t know it for sure , I am — at least perhaps . And do you have any notion how heavy the burdens that the work demands every day are for me , how hard to get models , how expensive the things needed for painting? Do you realize that it’s sometimes almost literally impossible for me to keep going? And that I must paint , that too much depends on pressing on with the work here with assurance immediately and without hesitation? A few weaknesses could make me fall in a way from which I wouldn’t recover for a long time . My situation is perilous on all sides and can only be won by working on determinedly . The paint bill weighs on me like lead and yet I must go forward!!!
I have to keep people waiting , too — who will nonetheless get their money — but — are waiting ; I’ve condemned a few of them to that . And without mercy , unless they give me credit . And the less credit , the more they’ll be made to wait . There’s no winning nowadays except with very good work , with things that are not mediocre . That higher standard costs more in money and — in difficulty and intense effort — yet this is the way , now more than ever .
What I’m telling you is plain and simple . Do you or do you not understand that it makes perfectly good sense when I point out to you that , if I want to find work here making portraits , it’s an absolute necessity for me to have my studio full of — very good heads?
This can be achieved , it’s something that one can see an end to , even if it’s not exactly easy to get them done .
 
Shall we now say , like the damned bores and fools: we can’t , we haven’t any money , there’s nothing to be done?
I tell you , no .
This is what we’ll say — and say together , if you please . We’ll be poor for it personally and suffer want — as long as we have to — just as one does in a besieged city that one does NOT mean to surrender , but we’ll show that we are someone .
Either one is brave — or one is cowardly . We must get to the point where we please the public — I mean , for example , the girls have to start liking their portraits . I believe that there are some who’d want them . I talked to a photographer’s assistant today about whether he couldn’t put some portraits my way . He wanted me to give him a commission for every girl he brought to me for a portrait . I let the matter lie , only in so far , though , as I didn’t promise any commission before and until I know this individual rather better . But I’ll probably see him again very soon .
And then I’ll see whether I can do anything with him directly , or whether I’ll go and talk directly to his boss about it . But sometimes the assistant’s better , you’ll understand , it all depends . Now I told him that I didn’t know him and that I’d like to see whether he could do anything , but that I’d be taking a risk because I always have to incur my expenses for a portrait . Anyway I’ll pursue this — but what’s pressing — is that I should be able to show fine heads .
 
I must also try to make some acquaintances among the girls , which is no easy task with a purse with little in it , I can assure you ; one is by no means doing it for one’s pleasure . But it’s not the effort that I find daunting . Only , I believe that you’ve become all too , all too accustomed to thinking it perfectly all right for me always to be neglected , that you all too readily forget that for so many years I haven’t had what’s due to me .
And that the desire I have to expand my affairs is good not just for me , but for you too , because it’s only by this means that we can earn .
And now something else . Theoretically , at any rate , you say that it’s necessary to be able to appear well dressed and all the rest of it on certain occasions , when one has to visit people , etc . Well then , now is the time even according to me who is in no hurry to do it — as you know — that it’s beginning to come to this .
Are such things necessary or not???
Does anything depend on them , yes or no???
Well , given this period of having to break through , the monthly allowance isn’t enough for me to possibly make do on it . You’re thrifty yourself ; you can imagine what absolute necessities are . And I ask you , can one possibly do what’s absolutely necessary with what’s left for me after deducting painting materials , models , rent? If I had friends , were a little known , yes , then , then it would be easier — but I don’t have any and I have to make myself known .
But I mustn’t forget to thank you for sending the second volume of De Goncourt . It’s a wonderful thing to be able to examine that era — from which there’s so much to be learnt for , to use the expression , our end of an era in which we are .
 
I can’t tell you how delighted I still am that I came to Antwerp . And how much there is to observe here for me , who has been out of things for so long .
How much good it does me — much as I love the peasants and countryside — to observe a city again .
How the bringing together of extremes gives me new ideas — extremes , the countryside as a whole and the bustle here . I really needed it .
Oh , if only I could make you understand how much more satisfaction you could have for yourself , how much more of a friend you would be to me — if , instead of the inflexible and cold neglect , and keeping me at a distance — think about last summer and previous summers! — you might at last come to the realization that this isn’t the way . Always to be in a state of exile , always hanging by a thread , always half measures .
But anyway — the family stranger than strangers — is one fact — Holland behind me 2 . THAT COMES AS QUITE A RELIEF . You see that’s my only feeling , and yet I had been so attached that at first the estrangement drove me mad , as it were .
But I’ve seen through it all too well to hesitate . And I’ve recovered my self-confidence and serenity .
The secret of that group — Delaroche-ishness , mediocrity .
Backwards — it offends me .
As to you — you’re still hovering between the two sides , and I’ve always said that your character still has to set in a definite form — that you still face an inner struggle and perhaps a struggle for your position in society , more serious than you have ever experienced .
 
I know this seems to you to be uncharitable to the people at home . And yet I tell you that Pa himself sometimes vaguely felt that he had chosen the wrong side . But he tried to espouse irreconcilable things at the same time and — — — wasn’t as firm of character as he appeared and as I thought he was in my young days , and even later still . Anyway .
As to the Tassaert exhibition — if ever anyone was wronged , it was he . Taking the opportunity to mention another — I don’t wait for exhibitions to form my opinion about painters — they’ll have to recognize Chaplin too .
As to Tassaert’s colour , he’s a harmonist and his work , painted in more or less one tone , is good because of the modelling , because of the fine sense of the female forms that he had , because of something impassioned in the expressions — and I think he belongs to the family of the Greuze and Prud’hon — better , more modern , more sound in his sentiment than Greuze .
Chaplin is more of a colourist than he is .
And I do think it’s rather a pity that Tassaert , who painted so wonderfully boldly , didn’t sometimes seek for more glow and life in the colour .
But he’s certainly better than Scheffer and Delaroche and Dubufe and Gérôme , who are so little painters . What a dreadful pity it is that a fellow like Gérôme , who painted The prisoner and who painted The Russian camp and The Syrian shepherd , has so much that is cold and sterile in him . People will also recognize Isabey ; Ziem too . Those two are very much painters and that , after all , is what it comes down to in painting .
They wrote to me from home at New Year and I also sent a postcard . But writing wouldn’t work , while I moreover believe that unconsciously , as a matter of course , they tell everyone everything , so — I wrote — goodbye for now — after all I’ll probably see them in the spring for some time .
I must close .
What the coloration in a painting is — it’s surely the enthusiasm in life and so — it’s no small matter to seek and preserve it .
With a view to getting models , this month I think I’ll go and see Verlat , who’s the director of the academy here — and I’ll see what the rules are and to what extent one could work from a nude model — I’ll take a portrait and some drawings with me when I go .
  I have an immense desire to improve my knowledge of the nude . I’ve seen a large bronze group by Lambeaux — two figures — a man embracing a woman — superb , something like Paul Dubois , say , or anyway the first-rate fellows . It’s been purchased for the museum . I often envy sculptors . But it’s much the same everywhere ; I have to earn a little more in order to be able to broaden out .
I also just want to tell you that , given my desire to study the figure — if I weren’t to manage it here — I might perhaps go further afield rather than go back to Holland before I’ve worked in a studio for a while . And that further afield — might possibly be Paris , without hesitation . You may be of the opinion that I’m an impossible character , but — that’s absolutely your business . I , for instance , don’t have to worry about it and I won’t worry about it . I know that from time to time you think better and differently , but I know that habit always makes you lapse back into that same mistake in regard to me . What I seek is so straightforward that in the end you’ll have to admit it . So let’s say in conclusion — the sooner the better .
Regards and with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
As regards the end of the month — I ask you most kindly but absolutely — let one of your creditors at least do without 50 francs (they can stand it , rest assured) but please not me , because EVEN THEN it will still be tough for me .
