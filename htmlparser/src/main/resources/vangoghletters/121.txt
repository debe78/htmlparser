My dear Theo ,
Well , what do you say about Anna? It surprised me , and it seems to be serious too , and will certainly take place , one would venture to say . It could be good . The difficulties of holding a subordinate position , especially when one perseveres in it for a longer period , as she has in fact done for years in all honour and virtue , are very great and sometimes become a hard struggle , and the seemingly easy becomes extremely difficult .
There’s nevertheless much poetry in it , and such years are a treasure not easily lost , and when one denies and humbles oneself , especially the first time , one has a wonderful feeling of inner peace , but I would understand very well if the future was sometimes dark for her too – it might be sensible of her , for her part , to have already decided to take this step . And I also maintain that she truly loves him , I believe that and trust in it absolutely , otherwise things wouldn’t have gone this far . And so I sincerely hope that she won’t be disappointed but that this , with God’s guidance , will be the path to her lasting happiness . May the Lord grant that she find peace , that dear sister , and bless her , and give her good things in life . On this occasion I congratulate you , too , as I have Anna and Pa and Ma .
How are you , old chap? I had wanted to write to you earlier and answer your last letter . I have a lot to do and the work isn’t easy .
 
Then again , I go to church a lot , there are beautiful old churches here , and outstanding preachers , I often hear Uncle Stricker , and what he says is very good , and he speaks with much warmth and feeling . I’ve heard the Rev . Laurillard three times , you would like him too , because he paints , as it were , and his work is at once lofty and noble art . He has the feeling of an artist in the true sense of the word , as someone like Andersen had when he says , for example:
Every evening came the moon and whispered in my ear ,
Telling of the quiet night and what its eye
Had lit on from its watch-post in the sky .
It who knows centuries – through ages did it roam ,
Casting , high above the Flood and crest of foam ,
On the floating ark a soft silver glow ,
Just as it now lights my lonely window
Then , too , when the folk of Israel knelt down
To weep by the waters of Babylon
It illumined with sad twinkling down below
The unstrung harp , hanging on the willow .
The moon still shines now , and the sun and the evening star , which is fortunate , and they often speak of God’s Love and call to mind the words , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world .
Am busy making a summary of the history of the Reformation , there’s much that is stimulating and appealing in the history of those days .
The room in the Trippenhuis where Rembrandt’s Syndics are hanging is open again ; coming from church yesterday I walked over there for a while , hanging right next to the Rembrandt is that portrait by Van der Helst .
Adieu , Theo , a hearty handshake in thought , I wish you the very best , and believe that often thinking of you is
Your most loving brother
Vincent
