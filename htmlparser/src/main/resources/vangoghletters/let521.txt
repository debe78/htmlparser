My dear friend Rappard ,
That there must necessarily be an end to this nagging is , in the first place , because it really would come to resemble the dispute between a certain two pious ministers who debated a difference of opinion concerning the geographical location of the road to salvation with so much fervour that at a certain moment , with one and the same gesture , they cast their respective wigs in each other’s faces . Those wigs should be part of it — and — how , with the best will in the world , shall we proceed now , for we’re just at the critical point and neither you nor I is in the possession of the indispensable projectile in question? I’m at my wits’ end for this reason , and I’m very sorry that we’ve started something that we now don’t appear capable of crowning with the above-mentioned end — so utterly worthy of the cause .
 
I think that the dispute has a decidedly ridiculous side , and would become more and more so , and really , that’s the reason why I don’t want to go into it any further . It’s just too absurd .
Be sensible , and put a stop to it on your part , too .
Everything that occurs to a person doesn’t necessarily come straight from his conscience — as if your conscience dictated those letters to you? — as if it was your duty to write them? — what — nonsense — laugh at it .
However , since you thought it was your duty and thought your conscience impelled you to do it , for my part I’m willing to let the whole matter with all its ramifications drop , and so be
DONE .
It remains — to ask you whether and , if so , approximately when you’re thinking of coming here to make a number of studies .
I would then see to it that you can stay with my mother as usual .
Sincerely ,
Vincent
