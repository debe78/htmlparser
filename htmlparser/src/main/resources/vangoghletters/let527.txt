Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve heard from that — who tells me I can send the paintings . But that he wants me to send them as soon as possible because there are many strangers in The Hague at present .
He’s quite right there . What I want to ask you is that you try to send me enough for me to get the crate made and pay the carriage . Deduct it next month , if you like — but I have nothing , and it’s important to me to get my consignment off immediately .
Your visit really left me with a less than favourable impression — I believe more than ever that more difficulties await you in the next few years than you imagine .
I continue to insist that it’s somewhat fatal that your energy has evidently taken a different direction , rather than working on our getting our heads above water with the painting . And yet it’s such a short while ago that you wrote that you now had more confidence that my work was good .
 
You take it as though I was doing you wrong or was hostile to you , now I most decidedly have rather a lot of remarks to make . And considerable concerns for the future . I can’t speak other than I did , can I?
To my mind you don’t in the least belong among the rising men now . Take this amiss of me — if you will — and treat me as you will accordingly .
I’m willing to take back my remarks should I see very different things in you , but that I made them during your visit — Yes . But even though you say today , ‘I’m selling 500 , 000 francs’ worth a year’ — this doesn’t make any impression on me at all , since I’m only too convinced of the precariousness of it all — you keeping up even a half or a fifth of that and delivering in the years ahead .
 
It’s too up in the air for me , too little at ground level .
And art itself is solid enough , that’s not the trouble .
But , ‘to be a counting-house will pass’ was said , not by me , but by someone whose words came dreadfully true . And I wish you were , or would become , a painter . I put it bluntly , more strongly than before , because I believe so firmly that the large-scale art trade is , in many respects , too much like tulip mania .
And the positions in it dependent on chance and whim . Make a miscalculation — make what may be an insignificant mistake — and — what’s left of that huge figure you’re turning over now? That figure depends on G&amp ; Cie’s whim .
And KNOWLEDGE of art , stripped bare , is related , more closely than you think , to the practice of art . TRADE in paintings is something very different when one is on one’s own from when one works for large distributors . And it’s the same with other things , too .
  Anyway — work hard — but — try to work sensibly too .
The trouble you’ve taken together with me — for providing money is also taking trouble and there’s absolutely no getting away from it — this trouble has at least been an act of personal initiative , and of personal will and energy — but what am I to think or say of it if , little by little , with the decided weakening of the financial aid , something else weren’t to be put in its place? And now , above all , to my mind at any rate , it’s the time to try to push ahead with my work .
I’ve also been looking for addresses in Antwerp , and will hear more precisely about them before long . Then I can probably send things there , too . But if you want these things , help me to bring them about .
You said to me yourself , Where there is a will there is a way ; well then , I’ll take you at your word a little as to whether you’re really seeking for us to make progress . If I were to ask for extravagant things and you refused , then so be it — but where they’re the most essential , the very simplest necessities , and the lack just becomes more and more , and worse and worse , then I think you’re taking economy too far , and in this respect it’s very far from being useful .
Regards .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
Just a word about Serret and about Portier . Tell them as it is , that is that I did have studies ready , but that I had to pay a who was making it difficult for me just now . That in order to put a stop to it , I wrote to tell him that I put his paint in my studies , and that I asked him to take the trouble to sell something for me instead of nagging . That I’ll go through with it , and have to send him things .
That as to the drawings which I said I’d show Serret , since I’m in a hurry to do things , I need them myself . But I do still think it’s of some importance that at any rate he knows that I really did have them when you came , and that you tell him that you saw them at my place , and then also tell him exactly what you think . I won’t influence your own opinion .
  That I’m sad about your thinking that this is all right , though , yes — that is so .
But I don’t refuse to take such measures — and even if one of these colourmen wanted to sell off my bits and pieces , he would be welcome to go to those lengths . It’s certain that the paint-dealing gentlemen wouldn’t blush to do it .
However , I’m fed up with talking about it ; I’ve said what I had to say — and you — you can deal with my suggestion as you see fit .
And if these fellows want to attack me and sell me up , since they expressly threatened me with collection , and that over matters of less than 30 guilders , then I won’t be able to resist them and will let them do as they please , but it will be as if it happens before your very eyes , since you’ve just been here . That I can’t stop the work at the level I now am , that’s true . I need paint &amp ; c . every day . I must make progress , and if I want to pay for what I need today , then an outstanding bill from yesterday will have to wait .
 
For your information , this is how it is with me for the rest of the year , precisely and in detail — I have to pay:
three suppliers who are all pestering me , one 45 guilders , the other 25 guilders , the other 30 guilders . These are the exact sums outstanding on accounts which have of course been much higher over the course of the year , but which I pay off in cash , as much as I possibly can with the utmost effort .
therefore

Add to this rent in November

250

 francs
Suppose I get 4 x 150 francs from you for Sept . Oct . Nov . Dec . = 600 francs . That then leaves 350 francs to last from now until New Year . And then bear in mind that I have
literally nothing left this month , and that I also have to live
this month .
So that from Aug . – 1 January , in other words almost 5 months , I have to live and paint on 350 francs . Which I can do on 150 francs a month , but not easily , but anyway it’s possible as a minimum .
However , if in the course of 4 months 250 francs has to be deducted to pay for paint and rent , well then , the work is
  hampered and obstructed so much that one doesn’t know what to do , and would rather say to the fellows sell my things then! But let me work! Without hesitation I’ve just thrown this month in to calm the fellows down . But the hardship that’s caused is bad enough .
And my last word on the subject is that if my work were weak and awful , I would agree with you if you said — ‘I can’t do anything about it’ .
Well — since larger and smaller painted studies as well as new drawings were able to make you understand that we’re making progress with it , I’m not so sure whether ‘I can’t do anything about it’ should be your final word . Talk to Serret , talk to Portier about it — and say how much I want to keep working and how little opportunity I have myself to find art lovers , since painting the peasants means that once and for all the countryside , not the city is my place of work .
