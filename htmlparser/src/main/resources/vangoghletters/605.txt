Letter|My dear Theo ,
I’ve just received your letter containing 100 francs , I really thank you for it — and for the previous one (also dated Brussels) containing 50 francs . This to tell you that I received them safely . But there should be at least 2 letters that I wrote to you in Paris and a roll of drawings , which , as you thought , Koning won’t have sent you . Koning sent me a postcard saying he’d received a note from the Independents , saying that if the paintings weren’t collected between April 5 and 6 they’d be put somewhere else , in storage . He just had to pick them up , if it was between May 5 and 6 that he meant . It’s likely that this excellent young man has somewhat lost his wits in your absence .
I’m pleased to hear you’ve sold a Degas and what you write about the purchaser . Meunier — I’ve also seen some very fine things by him myself — and by Henri de Braekeleer too , of course . The chap who came to Paris on behalf of Les Vingt , you know , Los Rios de Guadalquivir or an even more sonorous name than that , made out that De Braekeleer was reduced to helplessness by a brain disease that had completely stupefied him .
 
I like to think it’s not true . Have you heard about it?
You’ll see from the letters in question that I’ve rented a studio , a whole house with 4 rooms (180 francs per year) . Now it’s a matter of going there to sleep , today I’ll buy a mat and a mattress and blanket .
I also have 40 francs to pay at the hotel , so I won’t have much left over . But then I’ll be free of this guest-house where you pay too much and where I wasn’t happy . And I’ll begin to have a home of my own . You’ll find details in the letters I’ve already written to you .
The mistral’s been blowing hard here , so I’ve done a dozen small drawings which I’ve sent you .
The weather’s splendid now , I’ve done another two large drawings and 5 small ones .
I’ve found a crate for my consignment , which will go off tomorrow , I hope .
 
I’ll send you those 5 small drawings today , to Brussels .
You’ll see beautiful things at Claude Monet’s . And you’ll think what I send you is pretty poor , in comparison . At present I’m unhappy with myself and unhappy with what I’m doing , but I can glimpse some possibility of doing better in future .
And I hope that later on , other artists will emerge in this beautiful part of the country . To do here what the Japanese have done in their country . And working at that isn’t so bad .
I often took walks with Rappard in the place you mention . Is the suburb and the countryside beyond the Colonne du Congrès called Schaarbeek? I recall a place called , I think , La Vallée de Josaphat , where there are poplars and where Hippolyte Boulenger , the landscape artist , did some fine things . I remember sunsets in the Botanical Garden , seen from the boulevard that runs alongside it .
 
In the crate I’m sending you you’ll find some reeds for Koning .
And the address from now on will be
place Lamartine 2
I hope — and I have no doubts — that when you get back to Paris it will finally be spring . And not before time , for Heaven’s sake .
Living at the hotel you never make progress , and now at the end of a year I’ll have furniture &amp ; c . that will belong to me , and while that wouldn’t be worthwhile if I was in the south for only a few months , it’s quite another matter once it’s a question of a long stay .
And I have no doubts that I’ll always love nature here , it’s something like Japanese art , once you love that you don’t have second thoughts about it .
Handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
