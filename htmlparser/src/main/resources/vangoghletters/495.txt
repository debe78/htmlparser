Letter|My dear Theo ,
You’ll receive a number of impressions of the lithograph by the same post .
Do give Mr Portier many of them as he might want . And I enclose herewith a letter to him , which will seem to you — I think — rather long and consequently impractical . But I thought about it that what had to be said can’t be compressed into fewer words , and precisely what matters here is to give him reasons for his own instinctive feelings .
And anyway , what I write to him , I also say to you .
There’s a school — I believe — of — Impressionists . But I don’t know much about it . I do know , though , who the original and actual people are around whom — as around an axle — the peasant and landscape painters will revolve . Delacroix , Millet , Corot and the rest . This is — in my own feeling — not correctly expressed .
 
I mean — (rather than people) there are rules or principles or basic values for both drawing and colour — which one — proves to arrive at — when one finds something true .
As regards drawing — for instance , that question of drawing figures from the circle — that is , based on the fundamental oval planes , which the ancient Greeks already felt and which will continue to be until the end of the world .
As regards colour — those eternal questions — what , for instance , was the first question that Corot addressed to Français when Français (who already had a reputation) asked Corot (who didn’t yet have a reputation , or only a negative or fairly bad one) when he (F . ) came to Corot to ask things — What is a broken tone? What is a neutral tone? Which one can point out better on the palette than put into words .
 
What I want to assure Portier of in this letter is my — faith — precisely in Eugène Delacroix and those old people .
And at the same time , since , for instance , the painting I’m working on is different from lamplights by Dou or Van Schendel — it’s perhaps not superfluous to point out how one of the most beautiful things by the painters of this century has been the painting of darkness that is still colour . Anyway — just read my letter and you’ll see that it isn’t incomprehensible . And — that it — is about SOMETHING . And that something is a question that just came into my mind when I was painting .
I hope that the painting of those potato eaters will progress a bit . Besides that , am also working on a red sunset . To paint peasant life one has to be master of such an enormous number of things .
But on the other hand — I know of nothing that one works on with such peace , in the sense of peace of mind , even when one has a great struggle in material things .
 
Moving is causing me some considerable concern these days , because it’s never straightforward . All the same , it will have to happen , if not now then later , anyway , and in the long run it’s better to be in one’s own place , that’s for sure .
To change the subject . How rightly it was said of Millet’s figures — his peasant seems to be painted with the soil he sows! How accurate and true that is . And how much it comes down to knowing how to make on the palette those colours that one cannot name and of which everything — fundamentally — actually consists . Perhaps — I dare say certainly — the questions of colours , and specifically broken — and — neutral — colours , will preoccupy you once more .
To my mind , one hears people in the art trade speak of them so vaguely and arbitrarily .
And among the painters themselves , too , for that matter .
Last week I saw at an ’s a decidedly clever , realistic study of the head of an old woman by someone who’s directly or indirectly a pupil of the Hague School . But both in drawing and in colour a certain hesitancy , a certain narrow-mindedness , much more — it seemed to me — than one discerns when one sees an old Blommers or Mauve or Maris . And this phenomenon is threatening to become more and more general . When people conceive of realism in the sense of literal truth — namely precise drawing and local colour . There’s something other than that . Well , regards — with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
