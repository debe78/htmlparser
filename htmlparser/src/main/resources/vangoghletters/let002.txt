Letter|The Hague, 13 December 1872.
My dear Theo,
That was good news that I just read in Pa‘s letter. My hearty congratulations.
I don‘t doubt that it will give you pleasure, it‘s such a fine firm.
It will be a big change for you.
I‘m so glad that both of us are now in the same line of business, and in the same firm; we must correspond often.
 
I hope so much to see you before you leave, we‘ll have a lot to talk about.
I believe that Brussels is a very pleasant city, though it will seem strange at first.
At all events, write to me soon.
And now adieu, these are only a few words written in haste, but I just had to tell you how very glad I was.
I wish you well, and believe me ever,
Your loving brother
Vincent
I pity your having to go to Oisterwijk every day in this beastly weather. Regards from Rooses.
