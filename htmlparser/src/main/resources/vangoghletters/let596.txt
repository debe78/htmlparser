Letter|My dear old Bernard ,
Thanks for your kind letter and the croquis of your decoration included with it , which I find really amusing . I sometimes regret that I can’t decide to work more at home and from the imagination . Certainly — imagination is a capacity that must be developed , and only that enables us to create a more exalting and consoling nature than what just a glance at reality (which we perceive changing , passing quickly like lightning) allows us to perceive .
A starry sky , for example , well — it’s a thing that I’d like to try to do , just as in the daytime I’ll try to paint a green meadow studded with dandelions .
But how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination? This , then , to criticize myself and to praise you .
At present I’m busy with the fruit trees in blossom: pink peach trees , yellow-white pear trees .
 
I follow no system of brushwork at all ; I hit the canvas with irregular strokes which I leave as they are , impastos , uncovered spots of canvas — corners here and there left inevitably unfinished — reworkings , roughnesses ; well , I’m inclined to think that the result is sufficiently worrying and annoying not to please people with preconceived ideas about technique .
Here’s a croquis , by the way , the entrance to a Provençal orchard with its yellow reed fences , with its shelter (against the mistral) , black cypresses , with its typical vegetables of various greens , yellow lettuces , onions and garlic and emerald leeks .
While always working directly on the spot , I try to capture the essence in the drawing — then I fill the spaces demarcated by the outlines (expressed or not) but felt in every case , likewise with simplified tints , in the sense that everything
 
 
that will be earth will share the same purplish tint , that the whole sky will have a blue tonality , that the greenery will either be blue greens or yellow greens , deliberately exaggerating the yellow or blue values in that case . Anyway , my dear pal , no trompe l’oeil in any case . As for going to visit Aix , Marseille , Tangier , no fear ; if I were to go there , though , it would be in search of cheaper lodgings , &amp ; c . Otherwise , I’m convinced that if I worked my whole life , couldn’t do as much as half of all that is characteristic of this town alone .
By the way , have seen bullfights in the arenas , or rather , simulated fights , seeing that the bulls were numerous but nobody was fighting them . But the crowd was magnificent , great multicoloured crowds . One on top of the other on 2 , 3 tiers , with the effect of sun and shade and the shadow cast by the immense circle . Wish you bon voyage — handshake in thought , your friend
Vincent
