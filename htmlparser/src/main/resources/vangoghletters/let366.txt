Letter|My dear Theo ,
Coming home from Scheveningen just now , I found your letter , for which many thanks .
Many things in it give me pleasure . In the first place I’m glad that dark passages in the future can’t change our friendship in any way nor have anything to do with it . I’m also glad that you’re coming soon — and that you detect progress in the work . The division of your income , directly and indirectly , among no fewer than 6 people is indeed remarkable .
But the subdivision of my 150 francs among 4 living beings , while all the expenses for models , drawing materials , painting requisites and rent must be paid from them , also makes one think , don’t you agree?
It would be a splendid thing if we could raise those 150 francs from the work in the coming year — I take your visit as marking its start . We must confer about this . It’s a pity that I haven’t got a little further with painting , I must explain that again from the beginning . When you were here last summer , I had money from you to enable me to make a big effort . From that I had to pay Stam and Leurs , and I made some extra purchases and paid for them immediately and started work . Then , in addition , you wrote some time later that you were going to have some money coming in and that then ‘there’d be no lack of paint in the painting box’ . But that was not to be , for if you remember from that time on you yourself weren’t without your reverses . Nonetheless , at the beginning of the winter , or rather at the end of the autumn , I again received a little extra . Money for Leurs again had to be deducted from that ; I’d painted on those autumn days , including when we had storms on Scheveningen . We were then facing the winter and I thought it inadvisable to involve myself in new expenses , given the higher spending on fuel &amp ; c . , since little of the extra amount was left . Well , I then took lots of models again , and the period from then until recent days has most certainly been one in which I feel I’ve made progress with the figure .
But when making these figure studies it was absolutely impossible to buy paint or to do watercolours . For if you think back , you will remember how you thought you would be able to send several times , but it wasn’t possible , first you thought in March , but before that you had to withdraw money yourself .
  And had to take care of the and had the matter with H . van G . , and later business was rather at a standstill .
Well , I still wanted to do it sometimes if I thought there was any chance of managing it . Rappard advanced me some money , I had a little extra from Pa . But what happens? — like the May bug tied to a string , which can fly a little way but then comes up against something fatal .
I started things but as soon as the month ended I had to bend over backwards for weeks to pay the bill , sometimes almost unbearably hard up .
So I wasn’t always able to do what I wanted and want to do in my heart .
Still , not disheartened , we must hammer away at it again .
I’ve just brought back some studies for seascapes that could serve as the basis for watercolours like the very small one of the last visitors that I once sent you in a letter . We’ll do our best , but these are certainly difficult times .
What I had just started on , which is actually more pressing than anything else , is painting figure studies , but I’m baffled as to how to pay for it .
I had the studio altered as well . The position is that I myself have long lived on hope .
But you’re coming soon — that’s a good thing — at any rate you’ll then see what I still have here — and will see that I haven’t been idle .
I must , however , make sure I get my strength up , for if I recover some of that it’ll be high time to use it .
  For my strength has disappeared ; it isn’t normal for me to be tired after a short walk , such as from here to the post , but that’s how it is at present . Oh , I carry on of course , but I must do something about it .
My health doesn’t suffer (fundamentally or chronically) due to excesses , but due to a long period of too little or too insubstantial food .
Well , the urgent thing for making progress this year will be that there must be painting . Now I again ask you to consider something that I wrote about briefly last year but which I believe has slipped your mind .
Here I have to pay the retail price for paint &amp ; c .
Wouldn’t it be possible for you to get hold of paint from Paillard or someone like that in a certain quantity at the net price first hand , thus from the maker himself?
That would certainly be a step closer to having no lack of paint . And I’d be very glad if we could make an arrangement whereby you held back , say , 10 francs each time you sent . That makes 30 francs a month , 90 every three months , and I wouldn’t bother you for a few tubes each time but , if I had the net price list , say what was needed for 3 months . Could you give this some thought? I believe it would be a good measure . Whether it’s Paillard or Bourgeois or whoever isn’t important . As a dealer you’re probably eligible to buy at net prices .
 
I planned to speak to someone about supplying me with paint at net prices , but now that I’ve raised the subject I hear from him that he can’t do so .
You must see to it that you come soon , brother , for I don’t know how long I can keep it up . Things are a little too much for me , I feel that I’m giving way under them .
I tell you frankly that I’m beginning to fear I shan’t get through in this way , for my constitution would be good enough if I hadn’t had to fast for a long time , but again and again it was a question of either fasting or working less , and as far as possible I chose the first , so that now I’m too weak . How to endure that? I see the effects so clearly and distinctly in my work that I get worried about how to move forwards .
You mustn’t say anything about this , brother , for if certain persons knew such a thing it would be: oh , see , we foresaw and foretold that long in advance , and not only would they still not help me but they’d also cut me off from the possibility of patiently regaining my strength and recovering .
Given my present circumstances my work can’t be other than it is . If I can overcome my physical weakness , we’ll try to make progress ; I’ve already postponed and postponed getting my strength back because I have to take care of others and of the work . But now I’m at my wits’ end . Progress in the work isn’t to be expected before I’m stronger ; it has become all too clear to me of late that my physical condition has an influence on it .
I assure you that it’s NOTHING other than a weakening due to exertion and poor nourishment . Some who have talked about me on occasion as if I had some kind of complaint would start all over again , and that is gossip that’s very ugly , and so keep it to yourself without saying anything about it when you come here . But the dryness in the work is largely beyond my control , and will change if I can get back on my feet .
What I long for most is your coming , and for us to go through the work together and see each other again .
Regards , and in the meantime see that you write more often now and again , for I have need of it . And thanks for this last letter , mind — I wish you the very best .
It will no doubt be a question of having to fast again for the coming days until your letter arrives , write as soon as you possibly can .
