Letter|My dear Theo ,
If I’m to give you a better understanding of what I’ve already written to you about , you’ll have to know where its origin lies . And I mustn’t tone down anything about my visit to Amsterdam . But I begin by asking you not to regard it as impertinent if I have to disagree with you . And first of all thank you sincerely for the 50 francs you enclosed . If I don’t put it forcefully it will be no use to you , but I would keep silent if you made it a precondition that I give in . I don’t believe that you’re making such a precondition , and you yourself will perhaps not find it unnatural that there are aspects of life that are less developed in you than your understanding of business , about which I freely grant that you’re far better informed than I , and shan’t lightly dare to say to you this or that isn’t so . On the contrary , especially when you explain a little to me , I often feel that your grasp of things is better than mine . But on the other hand , when it comes to love — I’m sometimes astonished by your views . And I even want — please forgive me — to add something new . Your last letter about M . and H . G . T . proved to me that you appear to have a firm foothold in the circle and class of M . and H . G . T . and a way of behaving that isn’t mine , so that you get on well with them whereas I do not . But outside that class your view is superficial and prejudiced . For your last letter gave me more food for thought than you may realize . My mistake lies here , it seems to me , and this is the true reason for my being fobbed off . If one has no money , one is by definition ineligible from the start , and so it was a mistake and short-sighted of me to take what M . said literally , and to think even for a moment: H . G . T . will remember that I’ve already been through so much trouble .
 
These days , money is what might is right was in the past . Contradicting someone is fatal , and if you do it their reaction is not to reflect but to give you a punch in the throat . That’s to say , in the shape of ‘I shan’t buy anything by him any more’ or ‘I won’t help him again’ .
This being the case , I risk my head if I argue with you but , Theo , I don’t know what else I can do — if it must go , here’s my neck . You know my circumstances and that my living or not living , as it were , depends on your help . But I’m caught in a dilemma . If I reply to your letter: Yes , Theo , you’re right , I’ll give up Christien , then in the first place I’ll be telling an untruth by saying you’re right , and in the second I’ll be committing myself to do something terrible . If I contradict you , and you do the same as H . G . T . and M . , I get it in the neck , in a manner of speaking .
Well , in God’s name off with my head if you must . The alternative is even worse .
So here begins a short text in which I’ll state some things frankly which I think you may take in such a way that you withdraw your help , but to be silent in order to keep your help seems to me a poor way to act , and I would rather risk the worst . If I can make clear to you what I believe you do not yet understand , things will go better for Christien and her and myself . And to achieve that , I must venture to say what I shall say .
 
To express what I felt for Kee Vos , I said plainly: she and no other . Her ‘no , nay , never’ wasn’t enough to make me give her up . I still had hope , and despite that — which I believed was a block of ice that would melt — my love remained strong .
Yet I had no rest . The tension became unbearable because she stayed silent all the time , because I never received so much as a syllable in reply .
Then I went to Amsterdam . There I was told . . . When you are in the house Kee will leave it . Your ‘she and no other’ is opposed by her ‘certainly not him’ — your persistence is sickening . I put my fingers in the flame of the lamp and said , let me see her for as long as I hold my hand in the flame , and it’s no wonder that later H . G . T . might have looked at my hand .
But they blew the lamp out , I believe , and said , you shall not see her . And then afterwards I had a talk with her , who said , officially or unofficially , that nothing but rijksdaalders would have any effect . Official or unofficial , I find both equally vile , and when I left Amsterdam I felt as if I had been on the slave market . You see , to me that was just crass , especially when they spoke of my coercion , and I felt that the things they told me were meant to beat me to death , and that my ‘she and no other’ was beaten to death . It wasn’t straightaway but still quickly enough that I felt that love die , to be replaced by a void , an infinite void . Now , as you know , I believe in God , I did not doubt the power of love . But then I felt something like , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me? And nothing made sense any more . I thought , have I deluded myself? . . . . . . . . . O God , there is no God!
  I couldn’t bear that horrible , cold reception in Amsterdam —people reveal their true colours when it comes to settling accounts .
Would the Rev . J . P . S . and the Rev . T . v . G . , looking so respectable in their robes and with their grey hair , dare to preach about love from the pulpit the way they talk about it behind closed doors? They would not .
I thought of the words of the prophet: ‘Ancients of Israel , what do ye in the dark?’ , words directed at deceitful priests who were influenced by bribes .
Enough . I was distracted and cheered up by Mauve . I threw myself into my work with all my strength . Then , after M . let me down and I was ill for a few days , at the end of January I met Christien .
Theo , you say that if I had truly loved K . V . I wouldn’t have done that . But now do you understand better that I couldn’t go on after what had been said in Amsterdam? — should I have despaired then? — why should an honest man despair? — I’m no blackguard , I do not deserve to be treated so dreadfully . Well , what can they do? True , they had the whip hand , they thwarted me in Amsterdam . But now I no longer ask their advice and , being of age , I ask: am I at liberty to marry , yes or no? Am I at liberty to put on a working man’s clothes and to live as a working man , yes or no? To whom am I accountable? Who will try to coerce me?
If anyone wants to stop me , let him come forward!
  You see , Theo , I am faint and weary . Think it over and you will understand . Pa , Uncle Stricker , H . G . T . and I don’t know who else call themselves well-mannered , civilized people and they behave with a coarseness , a Jesuitism , an injustice that my soul abhors . Never ever is there a hint or shadow of remorse or an honest turning back to say , I did this or that , it was wrong .
They have too much support , they know all too well that most people want to have things that way , and they keep in with everybody .
If they take pleasure in that , if they think that it will work out well for them and that they’ll also be at peace with it at the end — well , let them go ahead — I can’t stop them . But for myself I may and must act according to my own conscience . And is my way less right because someone says , ‘You are straying from the right way’? C . M . always talks about the right way too , just like H . G . T . and the clergymen . But C . M . also calls Degroux a common fellow , so what is C . M . ? In future I’ll let him talk ; my ears are tired . To put it out of my mind , I’m going to lie in the sand in front of the roots of an old tree and draw them . Wearing a linen smock and smoking my pipe and looking at the deep blue sky . . . or at the moss or the grass .
 
That calms me down . And I feel equally calm when , for example , Christien or her poses and I work out the proportions and try to make the body with its long , undulating lines palpable under the folds of a black dress .
Then I’m a thousand miles away from C . M . , J . P . S . and H . G . T . , and much happier .
But . . . alas , then the cares come and I have either to speak or write about money and it starts all over again . Then I think: H . G . T . and C . M . would do so much better if they didn’t interfere with my ‘way’ and just encouraged me to draw . You will say: C . M . does that , but let me explain why the order hasn’t been completed yet . Mauve said to me: that uncle of yours only did that because he’d paid you a visit , but you should realize that it doesn’t mean anything and that immediately afterwards it will all be over , and then you won’t have anyone left .
You must understand , Theo , that I can’t bear that ; if something like that is said to me , my hand goes limp as if paralyzed . Especially since C . M . has also made remarks about manners , I believe .
For C . M . I’ve done 12 drawings for 30 guilders , that’s 2 . 50 apiece . It’s a tricky job involving more than 30 guilders’ worth of effort , and it isn’t fair to ask me to see it as a favour or something like that . I had already gone to a great deal of trouble for the other 6 , I had done studies for them . That’s as far as I got . I’ve already put the effort in for the new ones , so it’s not laziness
  — I am paralyzed .
Then I reason with myself: I shan’t take it to heart , but I’m nervous and a thing like that stays with me and comes back when I start work again . So that I have to change tack and work on other things .
I don’t understand Mauve — it would have been kinder of him never to have bothered with me . What do you advise: should I carry on with the order for C . M . or not? I didn’t know what to do .
Years ago there was a different tone among painters — now they devour each other and are fine gentlemen living in villas and intriguing . I prefer to be in Geest or another back street — drab , down at heel , muddy , sombre — but I’m never bored there , whereas I’m bored stiff in those mansions , and I think it’s a bad thing to be bored and so I say: I don’t belong there and I’m not going there any more . Thank God I have my work , but in order to work I still need money instead of earning it , and that’s the difficulty . If in a year’s time , or I don’t know how much longer or shorter , I can draw that Geest district or another street as I see it with the figures of old women , workers , girls , then H . G . T . &amp ; c . will be very pleasant , but then they’ll get my ‘go to hell’ and I’ll say , you left me in the lurch when I was in trouble , friend , I don’t know you , go away , you’re standing in my light .
 
Oh Lord , why should I be afraid? What do I care about H . G . T . ’s ‘disagreeable’ and ‘unsaleable’? If occasionally I lose heart , I look at The diggers by Millet and The paupers’ pew by Degroux and then H . G . T . seems so small , so negligible , and all those remarks so pathetic that my good humour comes back and I light my pipe and get on with drawing . But if at such a moment , sooner or later , someone from civilization were to cross my path , he might just hear some things that were pretty sobering .
Now you will ask , Theo , whether this applies to you too . In reply I say: Theo , who has given me bread and helped me? You , I believe , so it certainly doesn’t apply to you . Only sometimes the thought occurs to me: why isn’t Theo a painter , won’t he eventually become bored in that civilization in the end? Won’t he later be sorry that he abandoned civilization to learn a craft , marry a woman , put on a smock? But there may be reasons that I can’t appreciate , so enough . As for love , I don’t know whether you already know what its ABC really is . Do you think me arrogant? By that I mean that you feel what love is best when you sit beside a sickbed , sometimes without a penny in your pocket . This isn’t picking strawberries in the spring — that only lasts a few days and most months are drab and more sombre , but in that sombreness one learns something new , and sometimes it seems to me that you know that , and sometimes I think , he doesn’t know it .
 
I want to go through the domestic joys and sorrows myself so that I can draw them from experience . After I had left Amsterdam I felt that my love , which was truly honest , truly unfeigned and strong , had been literally beaten to death — yet after death one rises from the dead . Resurgam . Then I found Christien . It was no time to hesitate or delay . Action was required . If I don’t marry her , it would have been kinder of me not to have taken any interest in her . Yet through this step a gulf opens ; I then ‘marry beneath my station’ , as they say , as decisively as I possibly can , but that is not forbidden and not bad , even if the world calls it wrong . My domestic arrangements will be like those in a worker’s household . I’m more at home with that , I wanted to do it before but couldn’t put it into practice then . I hope that you’ll still extend your hand to me across the gulf . I mentioned 150 francs a month . You say I need more . Wait a moment . My expenses have never been more than 100 francs a month on average since I left Goupil , except for occasional travelling . And at Goupil I first had thirty guilders and later 100 francs .
 
Now , these last months I’ve had more expenses , but I’ve had to settle in , and I ask you: are these expenses unreasonable or excessive? Especially since you know what else was involved . And how often in those long years I had much less than 100 francs . And if I sometimes had expenses because of travelling , have I not improved my knowledge of languages and developed my mind? Was that money down the drain?
Now I need to make a straight path for my feet . If I postpone marriage , there will be something false in my position that will be repugnant to me . She and I are willing to scrimp and scrape as long as we marry .
I am 30 , she 32 , so we’re not starting out as children . As for her and her , the latter removes her stain ; I have respect for a woman who is a mother and I don’t enquire into her past . I’m glad that she has a child ; because of that she knows what she should know . Her mother is very hard-working and deserves a medal for the way she has raised a family of 8 children for years and kept their heads above water . She wouldn’t want there to be any dependence , she earns her living by going out to work .
I’m writing to you late at night . Christien is unwell and the time of her departure for Leiden is at hand . You must forgive me if my writing is sloppy , for I’m tired .
 
And yet , after your letter I wanted to write to you . In Amsterdam I was so flatly refused , so fobbed off that it would have been lunacy to persist .
But should I have despaired at that point? Jumped into the water or something like that? God forbid . I would have done that if I had been a bad person . I renewed myself , not on purpose but because I found an opportunity for renewal and didn’t refuse to begin again .
This time , though , things are different and Christien and I understand each other better . We needn’t take account of anyone , but of course are far from pretending to keep up a position .
Knowing the prejudices of the world , I’m aware that what I must do is withdraw from my social circle , which cast me out long ago anyway . But then there’s nothing more to be said and one may go no further . My personal liberty may not be infringed . I told my Father that plainly enough at the time of the Geel affair , when he wanted to pack me off to a madhouse . She and I are of age , so if Pa is opposed he’ll have to register his refusal formally according to the law and the judge will have to decide . However , I hope that this won’t be necessary and that we can reach a resolution by rather more peaceful means .
It may be that I wait a while before we start living together if our
  circumstances are particularly difficult , but even then I want to get married — without telling anyone , completely quietly . If anybody makes a fuss , I won’t take any notice . Since she’s a Catholic , the wedding will be all the simpler , for the church is naturally out of the question ; neither she nor I want to have anything to do with it . You will say , that’s short and to the point . So be it . I want to be concerned with one thing only , drawing , and she too has one regular occupation , posing . I sincerely wish that it were possible for me to take the house next door . It’s exactly big enough , because the attic can be turned into a bedroom and the studio is a good size and light , much better than here . But would it be possible? But even if I had to live in a hovel , I would rather have a crust of bread beside my own hearth , however poor , than live without marrying her .
She knows what poverty is , so do I . Tersteeg doesn’t know a damned thing about it , and neither do you , Theo . Poverty has its advantages and disadvantages . Despite poverty , we’ll take the chance . The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm fearsome , but could never see that the dangers were a reason to continue strolling on the beach . They leave that wisdom to those to whom it appeals . When the storm comes — when night falls — what’s worse: the danger or the fear of danger? Give me reality , the danger itself . Adieu Theo , it’s late . Pardon me for this letter , I’m tired but wanted to write anyway . I wish you could understand and that I could put it in a clearer and friendlier way , but don’t take offence , and believe me
Ever yours ,
Vincent
 
I believe (or rather there’s a glimmer of beginning to believe) that there’s a possibility that the notion ‘Theo will withdraw his help if I argue with him’ &amp ; c . &amp ; c . may be utterly needless . But , Theo , I’ve seen things like that done so often that I wouldn’t respect you less and not be angry with you if you did likewise . Because I would think , he knows no better ; they all behave like that , unthinkingly but not from malice . If I continue to receive your help , that will be something utterly new , a rare chance I haven’t counted on . Because for a considerable time I’ve gone around , so to speak , always with the prospect of the very worst before me , as has Christien , because I continually said to her ‘Lass , I fear a time will come when I’m completely penniless’ . But I haven’t said that to you before it was necessary . If you continue your help
  it is a solution , a deliverance , so unexpected , so undreamt-of , that I would be utterly overwhelmed by joy . And now , I daren’t think about it and resolutely push the thought away , even while I write to you about it with a steady hand , so as not to weaken .
What I experienced this winter with Mauve has been a lesson to me , making me prepare myself since then for the worst . . . a death sentence from you , that is , the ending of your help .
You’ll say , but that help hasn’t stopped . . . but I received it with a certain reserve , thinking he doesn’t yet know everything he will know one day , and until the crisis comes I’ll have no rest and remain on guard , prepared for the worst .
Now the crisis is here and I still can’t decide , I don’t dare hope yet . I’ve told Christien I’ll support you until Leiden . When you come back from Leiden , I don’t know how you’ll find me — with or without a penny — but
  what I have is as much yours and the ’s as mine . Christien doesn’t know the details — and doesn’t ask , knowing that I deal honestly with her and wanting to be with me come what may . The postscript in your last letter made me think . . . I thought , how does he mean that? . . . But up to now I’ve always thought of you as likely to turn away from me as soon as you knew everything .
So I lived by the day but with a sombre fear of the worst from which I dare not yet account myself freed . I also worked by the day , not daring to order more drawing or painting materials than I could pay for by the day , not daring to undertake anything in the way of painting , for example , not daring to tackle it as I would have done had I counted on relations with Mauve and H . G . T . being restored . Thinking that if their friendliness was superficial , their unfriendliness went deeper , and anyway , I took seriously what Mauve said , ‘it’s all over’ , not when he said it to me (for then I took it coolly enough in a spirit of bravado like the Indians who say ‘it doesn’t hurt at all’ when they’re tortured) , but since he wrote to me ‘I don’t want to have anything to do with you for two months’ . Since I broke the plaster casts .
In short , I’ve always argued to myself: I can expect nothing more from Mauve and Tersteeg , and I’ll thank God if Theo carries on sending me the needful long enough for me to support Christien safely until Leiden , and then I’ll
  explain to him and say , stop , this is what I’ve done .
Do you understand any of this? . . .
So I’m writing to you now as I spoke to Mauve when he said , ‘it’s all over’ — almost as a challenge — prepared for the worst — cold-bloodedly — sarcastically — and yet deadly serious , not sparing you , criticizing you for your conventions , yet not frivolously but . . . IN DAMNED EARNEST .
Do you understand now? Having just gone through the dreadful suspense with Christien , but she having pulled through , I am now pleading , declaring , Gentlemen , here is my neck . I plead guilty in that I hid from all of you something that has cost money , but there was a human life to be saved and I wanted to save it come what may , not talk about it . But now . . . if you condemn me I’ll be guilty and shan’t protest . I supply work for your money , but if it isn’t enough then I’m in your debt and can’t repay you . I’m prepared for your displeasure but not for your mercy . . . I’ve never counted on that and I don’t know how I stand . . . . . . what is it to be??? I’ve prepared myself for the worst and not hoped for anything less bad . What’s the position? But speak clearly .
In short , I knew very well that I was compromising myself in the eyes of the world by helping Christien , and I did not , or rather still do not , count on your wanting to have anything to do with me after knowing that I compromised myself . But I couldn’t leave her to her fate . I wanted to save her , even though my head might be at stake . And now I still don’t know whether it’s to be ‘POLLICE VERSO’ , yes or no??? If it’s yes: ‘Morituri te salutant’ . I’ve seen the thumbs move , but don’t know whether they’re pointing up or down .
