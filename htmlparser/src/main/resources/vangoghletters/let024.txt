Letter|Dearest Betsy,
I had wanted to fill this little book with drawings for you, but Theo is leaving today, so I don’t have any more time. You’ll just have to have it the way it is, and when I come back next year I’ll make a new one. Next Monday I’m going back to London with my sister Anna, to the house I’ve drawn for you, and then I’ll be travelling on the little steamboat that I’ve
  drawn here. Well, Betsy, adieu, until next year.
Vincent
