Letter|My dear Russell ,
I ought to have answered your letter ever so long ago but working pretty hard every day , at night I feel so often too weary to write . As it rains to day I avail myself of the opportunity . Last Sunday I have met Macknight and a Danish painter and I intend to go and see him at Fontvieille next Monday . I feel sure I’ll prefer him as an artist to what he is as an art critic , his views as such being so narrow that they make me smile .
I heartily hope for you that you will be able to leave Paris for good soon and no doubt leaving Paris will do you a world of good in all respects . As for me I remain enraptured with the scenery here , am working at a series of blooming orchards . And unvoluntarily thought often of you because you did the same in Sicily . I wished you would one day or another , when I shall send over some work to Paris , exchange a Sicilian study with me – in case you should have one to spare .
 
You know I thought and think such a deal of those of yours . I don’t gainsay that your portraits are more serious and higher art but I think it meritory in you and a rare quality that together with a perfection as appeared to me the Fabian and MacKnight portraits , you are at the same time able to give a Scherzo , the adagio con espressione , the gay note in one word , together with more manly conceptions of a higher order . And I so heartily hope that you will continue to give us simultanément both the grave and elaborate works and those aforesaid scherzos . Then let them say if they like that you are not always serious or that you have done work of a lighter sort . So much the worse for the critics and the better for you .
I have heard nothing of our friend Mr Reid . I felt rather anxious on his account because I feel sure that he was on a false track . My brother has received a letter of him but pretty unsatisfactory .
 
I was very much taken in by him during the first 6 weeks or 2 months but after that period he was in pecuniary difficulties and in the same acted in a way that made on me the impression that he had lost his wits .
Which I still think was the case and consequently he’s not responsable even if his doings then were pretty unfair . He is very nervous – as we all are – and can’t help being so . He is prompted to act in his crisis of nerves to make money – – – whilst painters would make pictures . . . . .
So much to say that I consider the dealer stronger in him than THE ARTIST though there be a battle in his conscience concerning this – of the which battle I do not yet know the result . So much – for your information – as I had the pleasure of introducing him to you , feel bound to warn you with the same sympathy however for him because I found him artistic in pleading the Monticelli cause . In the which I took and take my part . Witnessing the very scenery which inspired Monticelli I maintain this artists rights to public though too late appreciation .
 
Surely Monticelli gives us not , neither pretends to give us , local colour or even local truth . But gives us something passionate and eternal – the rich coulour and rich sun of the glorious south in a true colourists way parralel with Delacroix’ conception of the south . Viz . that the south be represented now by contraste simultané of colours and their derivations and harmonies , and not by forms or lines in themselves as the ancient artists did formerly , by pure form greeks and Michelangelo , or by pure line or delineation Raphael , Mantegna , Venetian primitifs . (Botticelli , Cimabue , Giotto , Bellini . ) Contrariwise the thing undertaken by P . Veronese and Titian – Colour . The thing undertaken by Velázquez and Goya to be continued and – more fully or rather more universally done by the more universal knowledge we have and possess of the colours of the prism and their proprieties .
Hoping to write to you again and to hear of you pretty soon ,
Yours very truly ,
Vincent
