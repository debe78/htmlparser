Letter|My dear Theo ,
Many thanks for your letter and 200 francs enclosed .
Thanks for letting me know the size of the frame , for which I’m thinking of making a little woman spinning , after the large study .
I was pleased to hear good reports about Breitner for once . As you know , the last impressions that I had of him were rather unfavourable as a consequence of 3 large canvases that I saw at his place and in which I literally saw nothing that one could locate either in reality or in an imaginary world . Still , a few watercolours he was working on at the time — horses in the dunes — were better , although very sketchy . And I saw in them things that mean I can readily understand that the painting you talk about is good .
As to the drawing society: first , I’d utterly forgotten about it because I was painting those particular figures ; secondly , now that your letter prompts me to think about it again , I have very little inclination for it since , as I already said to you in the summer , I wouldn’t expect anything other than a rejection of my application for membership , which rejection one can , however , regard as a sort of necessary evil that would be redressed another year , and as such the step acquires a raison d’être if need be .
 
But besides , since it completely slipped my mind , I don’t have a single watercolour in hand and would have to start new ones in a hurry , if it’s not already too late for this year .
And when I tell you that I’m just now absorbed in two new large studies of weavers’ interiors , you’ll understand that I’m not in the mood for it . Particularly since it could involve all sorts of unpleasantnesses were I to apply again to the gentlemen in The Hague .
As to these two weavers — one is a section of the loom with the figure and a little window .
The other an interior with 3 little windows that look out on the yellowish foliage , which contrasts with the blue of the cloth that’s being woven on the loom and the weaver’s smock , which is another blue again .
But for want of a good model I haven’t yet started on what has most struck me in nature these last few days . At present the half-ripe wheatfields have a dark , golden blond tone , ruddy or golden bronze . This is brought out to maximum effect by opposition with the broken cobalt tone of the sky .
Imagine female figures against such a background , very crude , very energetic , faces and arms and feet bronzed by the sun , with dusty , coarse indigo clothes and black caps in the shape of a beret on their close-cropped hair —
  while they go to their work on a dusty path of ruddy violet with some green weeds among the wheat , with hoes on their shoulders , or a loaf of rye bread under their arms , a pitcher or a copper coffee-pot . These last few days I’ve repeatedly seen that same subject , time and again , in all sorts of variants . And I assure you that it was thoroughly authentic , very lush and yet very sober , most perfectly artistic .
And it preoccupies me greatly .
The state of my paint bill is such , however , that I have to be a bit careful about starting new things in a larger size , and all the more so because it will cost me a fair amount in models if I could ever get suitable models of precisely the type I have in mind (coarse , flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips , not that sharp look , but full and Millet-like) and with those very clothes .
For this is very precise work , and one isn’t at liberty to depart from the colours of the costume , since the effect lies in the analogy of the broken indigo tone and the broken cobalt tone , heightened by the mysterious elements of orange in the ruddy bronze of the wheat .
It would be something that expresses Summer well — in my view summer isn’t easy to express . Usually , or often at least , a summery effect is either impossible or ugly that’s my feeling , at least — it’s offset by the twilights , though .
But I mean it isn’t easy to find the effect of a summer sun that’s as lush and as simple and as pleasant to look at as the characteristic effects of the other seasons .
 
    The spring is tender green (young wheat) and pink (apple blossom)
    The autumn is the contrast of the yellow leaves against violet tones .
    The winter is the snow with the little black silhouettes .
But if the summer is the opposition of blues against an element of orange in the golden bronze of the wheat , this way one could paint a painting in each of the contrasts of the complementary colours (red and green , blue and orange , yellow and violet , white and black) that really expressed the mood of the seasons .
Well , I’m very eager to hear how things are going with your trip to London etc .
Ma is still not making much progress with her walking . Wil’s gone to Noordwijk , and that’s a good thing . Lies has been here , but I thought that her work hadn’t progressed — she still hasn’t learnt to use her eyes and to make what she really saw or felt . It’s stuck at I don’t know what kind of hackneyed half-sentimental , half-religious view . But it can still change in time .
Regards , and thanks again for your letter and the enclosure .
Believe me
Yours truly ,
Vincent
The best I can think of — for the frame — is to take some little stretching frames of that size , then we can see what works out best .
