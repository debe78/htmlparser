Letter|My dear Theo ,
Your letter and the enclosure were most welcome , as always . And as always , thank you for them — I appreciate it all the more knowing so well that you yourself have many cares .
What you write concerning your is to some extent new and to some extent not . That you’ve written home about it , or rather will write , is something that will give you peace and is right . Naturally , I’ve never said a word about the matter , and you can rest assured that I won’t let on at home or elsewhere that I already knew something of it or am aware of more intimate details . And , I imagine , behave as if I first heard about it only recently , on a superficial level . But anyway , it’s unlikely that anyone will speak to me about it .
So rest assured on this point .
Well , I sincerely hope that everything happens as you have planned towards October , and am glad the time has come , sincerely glad both for you and for . I think this is for the best — especially because I know details — when one meets each other like that one should never again part .
And I sincerely hope that this summer it will be possible for you to come to Holland with . Who knows if precisely now some things to do with the woman may become clear to me too .
And so the Salon has opened . No doubt Messrs H . G . T . and C . M . will be paying you a visit one of these days . It’s now almost a year since I had the unpleasantness with him (i . e . with HGT) . I shan’t cross his path again , I believe he realizes that too , and he can rest assured that I hardly ever think of what occurred . It seems to me , should H . G . T . say anything to you about me , that you should cut him off more or less in this manner: Has V . obstructed you since then or bothered you? — given that he hasn’t , you shouldn’t make things difficult for him .
  It’s rather disagreeable to me that I always have to avoid the house of G . &amp ; C . out of discretion , on account of that difficulty with H . G . T . You know what H . G . T . wrote about me to Pa that time , for example — well , so far he hasn’t retracted his view that I’d made it impossible for him to have anything further to do with me . It goes without saying that as long as he holds that opinion of me I won’t set foot inside the premises on the Plaats .
Not , however , that I’m afraid of meeting H . G . T . , not because I want to hide from him or anything like that , but because I don’t want to give him offence .
If someone wants to have nothing to do with me , well I’ll help and try to avoid the few places where we might unintentionally bump into each other . Otherwise , don’t contradict such an opinion . From a certain point of view H . G . T . isn’t wrong — nonetheless , things could be viewed from another angle .
It could have been taken differently from the way in which His Hon . took it then . But that’s up to him . The reason I’m writing just a word about it is so that , supposing he speaks to you on the subject , you can tell him I no longer think about what happened other than that , to avoid what he might find indiscreet (given his plainly pronounced opinion of me) , I refrain from going into the premises on the Plaats and shall continue so to refrain as long as he holds the opinion of me that he expressed to Pa .
For my part I gave my opinion of His Hon . to you then , but not as far as I remember to others , influenced by various circumstances that were most disagreeable for me (displeasure with Mauve &amp ; c . ) . I freely admit that as a result my judgement of him wasn’t correct either and , on condition that H . G . T . takes back what he wrote about me to Pa (that I had made it impossible for him to have anything further to do with me) , I will take back my opinion that H . G . T . was to blame for disagreeable things that happened to me . If I express myself clearly enough , you may find in these thoughts something that could lead to more peace or better mutual understanding , which would be far from a matter of indifference to me .
 
If I count from last May , Theo , this year hasn’t been exactly easy or free of care , eh . But that’s nothing ; convenience or being without cares isn’t my ideal and goal either . Still , rather a lot has happened .
I find what you send not a little but a lot , yet although it was a lot — more even than you yourself could really go without — the and I have the devil’s own job to keep going and to make progress with the work and with housekeeping . Now it’s sometimes very unpleasant for me if relations are so strained that , for example , I must avoid the very people that one ought to meet in connection with the work , directly or indirectly . And I wish it was all cleared up .
Anyway , I’ve just about given up responsibility for that .
At the moment I have different kinds of work on my hands that I ought to carry through — and truly , I’m rather short . You write about Rappard — it’s so tiresome that he didn’t come when he wrote that he would — if I asked him to advance me something I’m sure he wouldn’t refuse me . For he himself proposed that to me this winter , but then he fell ill and we couldn’t correspond about the matter for which the money was to be intended , namely lithographs and drawings related to them . Then his wrote , ‘my son is ill but I know about it , if you are hard up I shall advance you the amount in question’ . I thought that was so good of R . ’s father that I would have found it gross of myself if I had immediately taken it then . And so wrote , ‘no , let your son get better first’ . Now R . did get better but I heard no more about it and he was absorbed in other work . And so that’s still pending and there’s always something that gets in the way of pursuing the matter . But I for one did carry on with it , namely drawing with printer’s ink , lithographic crayon , etc . , and indeed incurred considerable costs . He isn’t in the least responsible for that , but I just mean that that’s all the more reason why he won’t refuse , I believe , to give me an advance .
 
So I’ll ask him — but am expecting a letter from him and some time will probably pass before I’ve explained the matter and got a reply , for he’s sometimes a lazy correspondent . When the money from you arrived this morning I had no money — that is , had been absolutely without a single cent for about a week . Furthermore , I had run out of drawing materials . I was in discussions with Smulders about a batch of drawing paper and took it , although the expenditure was inconvenient now — but I had to have it and other materials such as the engravers’ printer’s ink and lithographic crayon . And had to pay various things and stock up for the housekeeping . And had to pay models whom I had had in the meantime so that I could carry on working .
I’m terribly sorry to have to ask but if it’s at all possible send me another 10 francs , say . A week’s work depends on it , for I shan’t be able to get an immediate answer from Rappard , am already short of cash , and have appointments with models . If Rappard then sends me some , there will again be a phase when everything goes smoothly until there can be a breathing space once more . If you can send some , work will come off the stocks rapidly this week , and otherwise there’ll be nasty damage to the vessel . But forgive me , there was a combination of costs (all unavoidable) that I couldn’t quite cope with . And if you haven’t got it — well — we won’t starve as a result . The difficulties in small matters about small sums are sometimes truly perplexing , and this is such a case . I hope R . will be able to help me a little , for I’m in need of it , just as the field needs a shower when it has long been dry .
Well , again I wish you all good fortune as regards your . The weather here is delightful at times ; no doubt it’s beautiful where you are too , and will do her good . Adieu .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
