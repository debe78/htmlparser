My dear Vincent ,
It’s indeed quite a serious oversight on my part to have spoken to you about De Haan and Isaäcson and not to have said what they’ve already done . I wanted above all to keep you au courant with what kind of people they are . The large painting , I haven’t seen it , but judging by a photograph taken of a drawing ,
  it shouldn’t have been as bad as all that . The subject is Uriel Acosta before a tribunal ; it’s a scene from Jewish history . The composition has nothing of Rembrandt about it , as the light isn’t concentrated on part of the painting but well spread all over it ; however , as the costumes are from that period , people said it was a poor imitation of Rembrandt . It’s certain that he has been subject to his influence , but even so , there’s a really personal quality in what I’ve seen of him ; it’s the way of spreading the light throughout his drawing . It’s mainly charcoal drawings that I’ve seen , their things having stayed in Holland .
  I’ll send you two photos of the drawings , so that you can judge ; the photos have come out very badly , because the drawings are matt . They consider Breitner one of the strongest of the Dutch today ; I don’t believe they put him above J . Maris , but well above Israëls . I believe that if you knew them you’d share my view , and that you wouldn’t have suspicions . I’ve seen nothing of Isaäcson yet apart from his croquis , which are very good and very original . He’s waiting for some drawings that should come back from London . Seurat isn’t in town yet , and I don’t know what he’s doing . He’s very strong , that fellow , and I agree with you that his carefully chosen frame was well worth all manner of expensive frames . Recently I’ve
  read Tartarin de Tarascon , which I find very fine , and Le Nabab , which I like much less . I’ll read the other Tartarin as well . Madame Chrysanthème isn’t in the library , but somebody has promised to let me have it to read . I’m curious to know it . It’s very annoying that you’ve had trouble with your eyes ; where does that come from? So Gauguin’s coming ; that will make a big change in your life . I hope that your efforts will succeed in making your house a place where artists will feel at home .
I’ll stop , because otherwise the letter won’t go off this evening .
Yours truly ,
Theo
