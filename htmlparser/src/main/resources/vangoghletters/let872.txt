Letter|My dear brother
After a last discussion with Mr Peyron I obtained permission to pack my trunk , which I’ve sent by goods train . The 30 kilos of luggage one is allowed to take will allow me to take a few frames , easel and some stretching frames &amp ; c .
I’ll leave as soon as you’ve written to Mr Peyron , I feel calm enough , and I don’t think that a mental upset could easily happen to me in the state I’m in .
In any event , I hope to be in Paris before Sunday to spend the day , which you will have off , quietly with all of you . I really hope to see André Bonger too at the first opportunity .
I’ve also just finished a canvas of pink roses against yellow-green background in a green vase .
 
I hope that the canvases of the last few days will compensate us for the expenses of travel .
This morning , as I’d been to have my trunk stamped , I saw the countryside again – very fresh after the rain and covered in flowers – how many more things I would have done .
I’ve also written to Arles for them to send the two beds and the bed linen by goods train . I estimate that this can only cost a good ten francs in transport charges , and it’s still something gained from the debacle . For it’ll certainly be useful to me in the country .
If you haven’t yet replied to Mr Peyron’s letter , please send him a telegram , in such a way that I may make the journey on Friday or Saturday at the latest to spend Sunday with
  you . In doing so I’ll also lose the least time for my work , which is finished here for the moment .
In Paris , if I feel up to it , I’d immediately very much like to do a painting of a yellow bookshop (gas effect) , which I’ve had in my mind for so long . You’ll see that I’ll be at work right from the day after my arrival . I tell you , as regards work , my mind feels absolutely serene and the brushstrokes come to me and follow each other very logically .
Anyway until Sunday AT THE LATEST , I shake your hand firmly in the meantime , warm regards to Jo .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
Probably the answer to Mr Peyron will already have left , which I hope . I was a little vexed that there were a few days’ delay , because that seems to me to be of no use for anything . For either
  I’d plunge into new works here , or it’s now that I have the leisure for the journey . Spending days doing nothing , here or elsewhere , that’s what would make me miserable in my current state of mind . Besides , Mr P . isn’t opposed to it , but naturally when you leave , your position is a little difficult with the rest of the administration . But it’s going well , and we’ll part amicably .
