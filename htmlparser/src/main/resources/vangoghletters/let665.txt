Letter|My dear Bernard ,
I want to do figures , figures and more figures , it’s stronger than me , this series of bipeds from the baby to Socrates and from the black-haired woman with white skin to the woman with yellow hair and a sunburnt face the colour of brick .
Meanwhile , I mostly do other things .
Thanks for your letter ; this time I’m writing in great haste and really worn out .
I’m very pleased that you’ve joined Gauguin .
Ah , I do have a new figure all the same , which is absolutely a continuation of certain studies of heads done in Holland ; I showed you them once , with a painting from that time , potato eaters . I wish I could show it to you .
 
Again it’s a study in which colour plays a role that the black and white of a drawing couldn’t convey .
I wanted to send you a very large and very carefully finished drawing of it .
Well — it turned into something entirely different , while still being correct .
Because once again the colour suggests the scorched air of harvest time at midday in the blistering heat , and without that it’s a different painting . I would dare to believe that you and Gauguin would understand it , but how ugly they’ll find it! You fellows know what a peasant is , how much of the wild animal there is when you come across somebody pure-bred .
I also have a man unloading a sand boat . That is , there are two boats , purplish pink , in Veronese green water , with yellow-grey sand , wheelbarrows , planks , a little blue and yellow man .
 
All of it seen from the top of a quay overhanging everything in a bird’s-eye view . No sky . It’s just a sketch , or rather , a rough sketch done out in the mistral .
Next , I’m attempting to do dusty thistles with a great swarm of butterflies swirling above them . Oh , the beautiful sun down here in high summer ; it beats down on your head and I have no doubt at all that it drives you crazy . Now being that way already , all I do is enjoy it .
I’m thinking of decorating my studio with half a dozen paintings of Sunflowers .
A decoration in which harsh or broken yellows will burst against various blue backgrounds , from the palest Veronese to royal blue , framed with thin laths painted in orange lead .
Sorts of effects of stained-glass windows of a Gothic church .
 
Ah , my dear pals , we crazy ones , let’s anyway enjoy with our eyes , shall we?
Alas , nature gets paid in kind , and our bodies are despicable and sometimes a heavy burden . But since Giotto , a sickly character , that’s the way things are .
Oh , and nevertheless , what delight of the eye and what laughter , the toothless laughter of Rembrandt the old lion , his head covered in a cloth , his palette in his hand . How I’d like to spend these present days in Pont-Aven , but anyway , I console myself by reconsidering the sunflowers .
I shake your hand firmly ; more soon .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
