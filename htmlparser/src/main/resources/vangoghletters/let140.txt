Letter|Amsterdam , 10 February 1878
My dear Theo ,
It’s Sunday evening , and I want to write a few words again , for I also really long to get another letter from you , do write again soon , I am with you so often in thought . I sincerely hope that you’ve had a good Sunday .
As you know , Pa was here and I’m very glad of it , we went together to Mendes , Uncle Stricker , Uncle Cor , Vos and Kee and Meijjes families , and the most pleasant memory of Pa’s visit is that morning we spent together in my study , looking over my work and talking about all sorts of things . You can imagine that those days flew by and when , after bringing Pa to the station and watching the train or even only the smoke for as long as it was in sight , I came back to my room and Pa’s chair was standing there by the little desk on which the books and notebooks were still lying from the day before , even though I know that we’ll see each other again quite soon , I broke down and cried like a child .
You’ll already have heard that Mendes made a favourable impression on Pa as well . In the evening , at Uncle Cor’s , we saw drawings and books , including Doré’s Bible and Bida’s Le livre de Ruth and Histoire de Joseph .
Was in the English church this morning and met Wierda upon leaving the church , who had been there too . We went for a walk together and he asked me if I’d like to come and see his room , he lives in Weteringstraat , about 10 minutes from Leidsestraat . I told him that for a long time I had wanted to see his room and where and how he lived , so I went along and after drinking coffee I stayed till around 3 o’clock and saw his books and heard a thing or two about his life , where he had been previously and so on , first he was in Bolsward , then in Haarlem and then here . He has worked hard in his life and will probably continue to do so and not give it up easily . Afterwards , at home , translated a passage from Caesar , and this afternoon to Uncle Stricker’s , I go there rather often now that Uncle is out of town and now that it’s lonely again here in the house since Pa left . This evening they went to see Vos , who isn’t any better .
I still have to congratulate you on Pa’s birthday , even though it’s already been and gone , it will have been a good day , with Anna there too , I’m longing for a letter from home to hear how they celebrated that day . Anna was slightly indisposed and hadn’t yet recovered completely , she wrote in a letter that Pa received here . Perhaps Pa read Ma’s letter aloud to you , which she wrote while Pa was here , it told about a visit to a sick person which sounded like something out of Adam Bede .
 
It’s foggy here today , fortunately Pa had good weather so that we could walk quite a lot .
I’m reminding you of that piece by Jules Breton , not that there’s any hurry , but try and remember it sometime .
Because in March you’ll probably make the trip again , won’t you , and also come here again?
Uncle Jan will most likely come back on Tuesday .
You’ll certainly have a lot to do at the beginning of the year , like most people . Wierda , too , unburdened himself on that score this morning .
For me , too , things are beginning to get more and more serious as the exam approaches . I’ll be glad when it grows light a bit earlier in the morning and we’re already beginning to get used to it .
Did Pa remember to give you the photograph of the Maris? The woodcut after Van Goyen , Dordrecht , is hanging in its place . Went recently to see that painting again here in the museum , it is good through and through . The next time you come here I’d like to look through the etchings by Dürer here in the museum again , as we did with Rembrandt’s last time .
It’s no doubt beautiful in Scheveningen on these grey days , do you still go there quite often? Perhaps it’s like that painting by Ruisdael in the museum in The Hague . Do you have the lithograph of it that was once in the Kunstkronijk? It’s really good .
How are things going at Mauve’s? Very well , I hope . Have you been there recently?
I’m currently taking lessons from Uncle Stricker once or twice a week , that is a bonus . Uncle is an expert in it , and I’m glad he could find the time to do it .
Now , old boy , a hearty handshake in thought , I’ll set to work , give my regards to your housemates , and also to Mauve if you run into him , I wish you the very best , write soon , also congratulations on Anna’s birthday , even though it’s still to come , and believe me ever
Your loving brother
Vincent
Good-night , old boy , I sat up writing till 12 o’clock , a handshake in thought .
