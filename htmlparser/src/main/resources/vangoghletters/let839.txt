Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your last letter , I hope that Wil has recovered from her indisposition and that it was no more serious than you say . Thanks very much , too , for the consignment of canvases and colours , which has just arrived . I have enough subjects for paintings in my head for when the weather permits me to work outside .
What you say about the copy after Millet , The evening , pleases me . The more I think about it the more I find that there’s justification for trying to reproduce things by Millet that he didn’t have the time to paint in oils . So working either on his drawings or the wood engravings , it’s not copying pure and simple that one would be doing . It is rather translating into another language , the one of colours , the impressions of chiaroscuro and white and black . In this way I’ve just finished the three other ‘times of the day’ after the wood engravings by Lavieille . It took me
  a lot of time and a lot of trouble . For you know that this summer I’ve already done The labours of the fields . Now these reproductions – you’ll see them one day – I haven’t sent , because more than the former ones they were gropings , but they have , however , served me well for The times of the day . Later , who knows , perhaps I could do lithographs of them . I’m curious as to what Mr Lauzet will say about them . They’ll take a good month more to dry , the last three , but once you have them you’ll clearly see that they were done through a most profound and sincere admiration for Millet . Then , even if they’re criticized one day or despised as copies , it will remain no less true that it’s justifiable to try to make Millet’s work more accessible to the ordinary general public .
Now I’m going to talk to you again about what I think we could do for the future so as to have fewer expenses . At Montevergues there’s an asylum where one of the employees here used to be a warder . He tells me that there they only pay 22 sous
  a day , and that then the patients are even dressed by the establishment . Then they’re put to work on the lands that belong to the house , and there’s also a forge , a carpenter’s workshop &amp ; c . Once they’d got to know me a little I don’t think I’d be forbidden to paint , then for one thing there’s still the fact that it’s less expensive , and second , that one can work at something . So with good will one isn’t unfortunate there , nor is one to be pitied too much . Now , even leaving Montevergues aside , returning to Holland , aren’t there establishments in our native country where people work too and where it isn’t expensive , and which one has the right to benefit from , while I’m not too sure if there might not be a slightly higher rate at Montevergues for foreigners , and above all admission difficulties which it’s better to avoid . I must tell you that it reassures me a little to tell myself that we can simplify things if we need to . For at present it costs too much , and the idea of going to Paris then to the country , having no other resource to combat the expenses than painting , means manufacturing paintings that come quite expensive .
You must talk about it one day with C . M . , should you see him , and tell him frankly that I’ll willingly try to do what’s for the best , that I have no preference whatsoever .
 
I saw Mr Peyron again this morning , he says that he’s allowing me complete freedom to distract myself , and that I must react against the melancholy as much as I can , which I’m gladly doing . Now , it’s a good reaction to ponder resolutely , and it’s also a duty . Now , you understand that in an establishment where the patients work in the fields I would find hosts of subjects for paintings and drawings , and that I wouldn’t be at all unhappy there . Anyway , it’s necessary to ponder while we have the time to ponder .
I think that if I came to Paris I wouldn’t do anything but draw Greek casts again at first , because I must always keep on studying .
For the moment I feel very well , and I hope that it’ll remain like that .
And I even have hopes that it will be dispelled even more if I return to the north . Just mustn’t forget that a broken pitcher is a broken pitcher , and so I have no right at all to entertain pretensions .
I tell myself that at home in Holland people always value painting more or less , that in an establishment they’d hardly make difficulties about letting me do it . Now , it would still be a lot , however , to have the opportunity to occupy oneself over and above painting , and it would cost less . Hasn’t the countryside and working there always been to our taste? And aren’t we a little indifferent , you as much as I , to the life of a big city?
I must tell you that at moments I still feel too well to be idle , and in Paris I fear I wouldn’t do anything good .
 
So when you see C . M . , and it seems very likely to me that he will indeed drop by in February to see the little one you’re expecting , let’s try a little to act firmly .
I can and I indeed want to earn some money with my painting , and we ought to ensure that my expenses don’t exceed its value , and even that the money spent comes back little by little . Well , that can be done with energy , and it’s a duty . With good behaviour I think that one can arrive at some relative freedom , even in an establishment for the insane . And it seems to me that the attacks have been too frequent , too decisive , to cease considering myself as ill .
To talk of something else – I can’t manage to see the south like the good Italians , Fortuny , Jiménez , Tapiró and others – how on the contrary it makes me see more with my northern eyes!
It isn’t , believe me , that I wouldn’t wish to be able to live like before , without this preoccupation with health . Anyway , we’ll make the attempt once but probably not twice in the spring if it goes away completely .
 
Today I took the ten francs that were still with Mr Peyron . When I go to Arles I’ll have to pay 3 months’ rent on the room where my furniture is . That’ll be in February . This furniture , it seems to me , will be of use , if not to me then to another painter wanting to settle in the country .
Wouldn’t it be wiser , in the event of leaving here , to send it to Gauguin , who’ll probably spend more time in Brittany , than to you , who’ll have nowhere to put it . This is another thing we need to consider in time .
I think that in giving up two very old , heavy chests of drawers to someone , I could exempt myself from paying the remainder of the rent and perhaps the packing costs . They cost me around thirty francs . I’ll drop a line to Gauguin and De Haan to ask if they’re planning to stay in Brittany and if they’d like me to send the furniture , and then if they want
  me to come too . I won’t commit myself to anything , only say that I’m very probably not staying here .
This week I’m going to start on Millet’s ‘Snow-covered field’ and ‘First steps’ in the same format as the others . Then there’ll be 6 canvases forming a series , and I assure you that I’ve worked on them , these last three of the ‘Times of the day’ , with much thought to calculate the colour .
You see , these days there are so many people who don’t feel made for the public but who support and consolidate what others do . Those who translate books , for example . The engravers , the lithographers . Take Vernier , for example , and Lerat . So that’s to say that I don’t hesitate to make copies . If I had the leisure to travel , how I’d like to copy the works of Giotto , this painter who would be as modern as Delacroix if he weren’t primitive , and who’s so different from the other primitives . I haven’t seen much of his work , though . But there’s one who is consolatory .
So what I’m pondering doing in painting is Daumier’s Drinkers
  and Régamey’s Penitentiary . You’ll find them in among the wood engravings . I’m busy with the Millet for the moment , but this is to say that I’ll find no lack of things to work on . Thus even half locked up I’ll be able to occupy myself for a long time .
What the Impressionists have found in colour will develop even more , but there’s a link that many forget which links this to the past , and I’ll make efforts to show that I have little belief in a rigorous separation between the Impressionists and the others . I find it a very happy thing that in this century there have been painters like Millet , Delacroix , Meissonier , who cannot be surpassed . For although we don’t like Meissonier as much as certain individuals do , there’s no getting away from it , when one sees his Readers , his Halt and so many other paintings – that really is something . And then one’s leaving aside his strongest point , i . e . military painting , because we like that less than the fields . Nevertheless , to be fair we must say that what he’s done cannot be surpassed or changed . Once again I hope that our has recovered .
Warm regards to all .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
