Letter|My dear Theo ,
Enclosed a few interesting pages about colour , that is , the great verities in which Delacroix believed .
Add to this ‘the ancients didn’t start from the line but from the centres’ ; that is , beginning with the circular or elliptical bases of the masses instead of the outline . I found the right words for the latter in Gigoux’s book , but the thing itself had already occupied me for a long time . It seems to me that the more what one does is felt and has life , the more it’s criticized and gives offence , but at the same time it overcomes the criticism in the long run .
What you write to me about Mr Portier certainly pleased me greatly , but the question is whether he sticks to it . Only , I know that they do exist , these certainly rather rare people who have collier’s faith and aren’t moved hither and thither by public opinion .
That he detected personality in it pleases me very much indeed , and anyway I’m also trying more and more to be myself , remaining relatively indifferent as to whether people think it very ugly or better . That’s not to say that it would be a matter of indifference to me whether Mr Portier sticks to the opinion he has formed — on the contrary , I’ll try to make things that confirm him in it .
 
You’ll receive a couple of copies of a lithograph by this post .
I’d like to work up the sketch I painted in the cottage , with a few changes , into a definitive form of painting . And could perhaps be one that Portier could show or that we could send to an exhibition . At least it’s a thing that I’ve felt , and one such that I would be able to point to defects and certain errors in it myself , just as well as other critics .
Yet there’s a certain life in it , and perhaps more than in certain paintings in which there are no errors at all .
I also think that if it had been up to Henri Pille , Le Chat Noir might not have refused it .
I’m not much bothered about it , anyway , because I want to learn to make lithographs myself so as to be independent .
If I work the sketch up into a painting , I’ll also make a new lithograph of it , and such that the figures — which are now reversed , I’m sorry to say — come right again .
I’m ending now so that the letter doesn’t become too bulky , because Ma’s also going to write . More later , and thanks for your letter . With a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
 
The ancients accepted only three primary colours , yellow , red and blue , and modern painters don’t accept any others . These three colours , in fact , are the only ones that can’t be broken down and are irreducible . The whole world knows that the sun’s rays break down into a series of seven colours , which Newton called primary: violet , indigo , blue , green , yellow , orange and red ; but it’s clear that the name ‘primary’ wouldn’t fit three of these colours , which are composite , since orange is made with red and yellow — green with yellow and blue — violet with blue and red . As for indigo , it can’t be counted among the primary colours , either , since it’s no more than a variety of blue . We must therefore acknowledge with Antiquity that in nature there are only three truly elementary colours , which , by being mixed two by two , create three other composite colours , called binaries: orange , green and violet .
These rudiments , developed by modern scholars , have led to the notion of certain laws , which form a luminous theory of colours — a theory that E . Delacroix mastered scientifically and thoroughly , after having instinctively known it .
  (See Grammaire des arts du dessin , 3rd ed . , Renouard) .
If one combines two of the primary colours — yellow and red , for example , in order to create a binary colour , orange , this binary colour will attain its maximum brilliance when one places it close to the third primary colour , not used in the mixture . Similarly , if one combines red and blue to produce violet — that binary colour — the violet will be heightened by the immediate proximity of yellow . Lastly , if one combines yellow and blue to form green , this green will be heightened by the immediate proximity of red . Each of the three primary colours is rightly called Complementary in relation to the binary colour that corresponds with it . Thus blue is the complementary of orange , yellow is the complementary of violet , and red the complementary of green . Vice versa , each of the composite colours is the complementary of the primary colour not used in the mixture . This reciprocal heightening is what’s called the law of simultaneous contrast .
 
If the complementary colours are taken at equal value , that’s to say , at the same degree of brightness and light , their juxtaposition will raise both the one and the other to an intensity so violent that human eyes will scarcely be able to bear to look at it . And by a singular phenomenon , these same colours , which are heightened by being juxtaposed , will destroy one another by being mixed . Thus — when one mixes together blue and orange in equal quantities , the orange being no more orange than the blue is blue — the mixing destroys the two tones and the result is an absolutely colourless grey .
But — if one mixes together two complementaries in unequal proportions , they only partially destroy one another , and you’ll have A BROKEN TONE — which will be a variety of grey . That being so , new contrasts will emerge from the juxtaposition of two complementaries , one of which is pure and the other broken . The contest being unequal , one of these two colours triumphs , and the intensity of the dominant one doesn’t prevent there being harmony between the two .
 
Because if one now brings together similar colours in the pure state , but with differing degrees of energy , for example , dark blue and light blue , one will obtain a different effect , in which there will be a contrast by virtue of the difference in intensity , and harmony by virtue of the similarity . Lastly , if two similar colours are juxtaposed , one in the pure state , the other broken — for example , pure blue with grey blue , the result will be another sort of contrast which will be tempered by the analogy between them . One can thus see that there exist several ways , different from each other , but equally infallible , of strengthening , supporting , attenuating or neutralizing the effect of a colour , and they involve working on what’s next to it — by touching what isn’t the colour itself .
In order to heighten and harmonize his colours , he uses the contrast between complementaries and agreement between analogues all together , in other words , the repetition of a vivid tone by the same broken tone .
