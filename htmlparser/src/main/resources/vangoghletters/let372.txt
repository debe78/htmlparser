Letter|My dear Theo ,
The news that you’re already on the way by now gave me great pleasure . Thanks for your letter and the enclosure .
I don’t need to tell you that I’m eagerly looking forward to seeing you — I’ve been far from well in the last few days — always the same thing — heart palpitations as well at times — in the end , with me it may come down to the heart being affected . Well , I don’t know all about it in detail , but I do know that you mustn’t mention it at home or to anyone else for fear of it being misconstrued in their ideas of my circumstances .
By which I mean only that I want to do something good , come what may , and there’s a chance of bringing that about if we keep our serenity , dark future or no dark future .
I could meet you if I knew when , that’s to say on which train , you were coming . And supposing you come to see me while I’m out , the can tell you where I am because , so as not to miss you , I’m not going further from home than the Binkhorst behind here , to paint some studies .
 
I’m very curious to know what you’ll think of the work , whether there’ll be anything which you think has something or not . Well , we’ll see . I keep thinking about undertaking the potato grubbers as a large painting , although it wouldn’t be finished before next year , and only half finished this season . It seems to me that the composition could stay as it is and a start could be made on it .
I’m not competent to determine the extent to which my feeling unwell has a physical cause or is due to nervous tension . It seems to me as if I ought to have been able to talk to you in the meantime and discuss the work , but now you’ve come at last and I firmly believe that our being together will calm me down at any rate .
  I hope we’ll also go for a long walk together . Did I write to you that I had found thorn-bushes at Loosduinen exactly like Ruisdael’s Bush?
That’s the area in which I propose to do studies for the potato grubbers .
I hope I’ll soon be completely normal again , I’ll do my best at that , for I thoroughly detest not being able to make headway as I could if I had my full strength . As regards what I wrote to Rappard , that I didn’t think I was put into the world to conserve my constitution , this is a question of there being circumstances in which one must choose between working and not eating , or eating and letting the work go hang (namely when the work leads to expenses and for the time being produces no return) . Well , in some cases I chose the former , and I don’t believe that was a mistake , since our work remains but we ourselves defnitely do not , and having something to do is life , and I would rather have a few years of that than many years of just daydreaming about it and procrastinating . And I also said then to Rappard that I , for one , thought there was truth in the mysterious words , whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for the sake of something higher shall find it .
Adieu , old chap , goodbye for now , with a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
