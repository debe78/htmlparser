Letter|My dear Theo ,
I tore up a letter that I wrote to you first , and that’s why you’re receiving my reply a little later . I’ll start by thanking you for the 50 francs .
Which I appreciate as , for that matter , I do everything you do for me . But as I started to say , your letter disappoints me since you don’t accede to my request , because I still continue to believe so strongly that the reasons which I gave you in my last letter for preferring to come even sooner were justified . But since I don’t want to argue about that , after all , I just wanted to ask you to reconsider it again .
With a view to Cormon , it’s decidedly better for me to go on drawing plaster casts rather than working outdoors , because the more I have the structure of the figure in my head , the better I’ll be able to follow . I’ll be dealing with fellows who’ve been drawing plaster casts for years ; if I do it for months , it’s not too much .
 
Because I’ve always worked from nature , I may perhaps be more daring than many others in dashing things off and tackling a group of things . But the others will most likely have more knowledge of the nude , for which I haven’t had so much opportunity . If I make up for that — the sooner the better — the more benefit I’ll get from Cormon . Moreover , my health — when I paint outdoors I don’t eat — and I won’t overcome it .
For I keep relapsing ; my constitution is still far from strong .
And now as regards the cost , I believe it’s six of one and half a dozen of the other .
So think it over carefully again .
We must act , because we have to put our backs into it .
While I’ve been here — all this time — I’ve had a comrade , an old Frenchman . I’ve painted his portrait , which Verlat liked and which you will see .
 
The winter was even harder for him than for me , and the poor devil is in a much worse state than I am , since his age makes it very critical .
Today I went with him to the same I went to myself , and he’ll probably have to go into hospital and undergo an operation , which will be decided tomorrow . I eventually got him to that point , but he was dreading it so much that it took a long time before I could persuade him to go and hear the verdict . He knew that it was likely to be something quite serious and dared not entrust himself to the hospital doctor . I’m curious as to what will be decided . It’s possible I may stay here a few days longer in March for his sake .
After all , there’s nothing in the world as interesting as people , and one is never done with studying them . And that’s why people like Turgenev are great masters , because they learn to look at a person .
The books of the present , since Balzac , say , are unlike anything written in other centuries — and better perhaps .
 
I’m really looking forward to Turgenev just now because I’ve read a piece about him by Daudet in which both the man himself as a character and his work were analyzed — extremely good . For he’s an example as a person , and in his old age he was still young as regards continuing to work , as regards always being dissatisfied with himself , and trying to do it better and better all the time .
Regards — but do think about it again carefully ; it would greatly reassure me if you could see the matter as I do .
And I wouldn’t insist on it like this if I didn’t think it was necessary , with a view to June , specifically , for me to go on drawing plaster casts at once .
Anyway , write to me soon . For my own pleasure I’d rather paint something else , but as far as practical use is concerned , it’s unavoidable . With a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
It’s precisely because I think , after all , that I’ve derived benefit from coming to Antwerp that I believe we should go straight on .
