My dear Vincent ,
Enclosed you’ll find 150 francs – for Mr Peyron and for your journey to Arles . I had said in my letters to Mr Peyron that he ought to tell me if he’d had additional expenses , he has never spoken of them . Ask him then , if you will , to tell me if anything is owing to him each time he acknowledges receipt of my monthly letter , then it doesn’t mount up . I hope that you’re
  still well and that you have good luck with work . I’ve had several people to see your paintings . Israëls’ , who has been living in Paris for a while , Veth , a Dutchman who does portraits and who writes in De Nieuwe Gids , that journal you’ve perhaps heard about that makes people so indignant but in which good things often appear , and then Van Rijsselberghe , one of the Vingtistes from Brussels , the latter also saw everything there is at Tanguy’s , and your works seem to interest him a great deal . In Belgium they’re already more accustomed to brightly coloured painting , the Vingtistes’ exhibition did a lot of good in that respect , despite the fact that nobody’s buying anything there . The Independents’ exhibition is
  finished and I have your irises back ; it’s one of your good things . I consider that you’re strongest when you’re doing real things , like that , or like the Tarascon diligence , or the ’s head , or the upright undergrowth with the ivy . The form is so well defined and the whole is full of colour . I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight or the mountains , but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things . In Gauguin’s last consignment there are the same preoccupations as with you , but with him there are a lot more memories
  of the Japanese , the Egyptians etc . As for me , I prefer to see a local Breton woman than a Breton woman with the gestures of a Japanese woman , but in art there are no limits , so it’s quite permissible to do as one sees it . Guillaumin was in Auvergne this summer , from where he brought back some good canvases . He doesn’t search for much that’s new in the coloration . He’s content with what he’s found , and one always finds his same pink , orange and violet blue patches again , but his touch is vigorous and his view of nature is quite broad . Pissarro has left and will be busying himself with that worthy in Auvers . I hope that he’ll succeed , and that next spring , if not sooner , you’ll come to see us . Jo is well , she’s getting considerably bigger and can already feel the child quickening , but that doesn’t cause her too much inconvenience . Mother sent us a letter from Cor . He has arrived in Johannesburg . It’s a very wild country where you have to walk around with a revolver all day . There are no plants , nothing but sand . Except in places that are like oases . My letter must go off . Jo sends her warm regards . Accept a good handshake , and
Ever yours ,
Theo
