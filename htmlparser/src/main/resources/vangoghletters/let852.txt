My dear Vincent
You gave us great pleasure with your last letter , and fortunately we can see that things are going fairly well as regards your health .
Things are going well at home with us , Jo is nursing the and has no lack of milk , and the little one sometimes lies down with his eyes wide open and his fists against his face . Then he has the look of being completely well . He has blue eyes like the
  you painted , and fat cheeks . He gives his mother all sorts of trouble , but that seems inevitable and she bears it very well . In a few days from now she’ll be able to get up . This morning Wil left , she gave us a lot of help in the household . She’s a good girl . I was once with her at Degas’s place ; he said that she reminded him of several figures from the old Dutch paintings , and made him very much want to go and see the museums in our country . He brought out several things to show her , which pleased her greatly . She understood the female nudes very well . One morning , too , we were in the Louvre , where several paintings
  have been moved . The Vermeer of Delft at eye height , Rembrandt’s little Philosophers are cleaned a little , which enables one to see them as never before . The Infanta Marguerita is in the Salon Carré . Anyway , they’ve made a few reorganizations that were really necessary . The who came to Jo said of Wil , she’s really much too good to get married . Nevertheless I’d be really happy if she were . Yesterday Gauguin came to Paris and he asked a lot of questions about you . He has come here to see if he can find a position to do anything at all to earn his living , for it seems that De Haan is very hard up too . His family don’t understand at all why he doesn’t remain with them , and as
  they’re terrible Jews they’re probably thinking that they can force him to come back by cutting off his allowance . De Haan sent me a painting to dispatch to his brother . One can see that he’s trying very hard , it’s pink and orange onions , green apples and an earthenware pot . It’s very carefully studied as regards values and influence of tones , one on another . I’d like to see a little more casualness in it , but it’s very carefully studied and kept in quite a bright range of colours . There are three exhibitions here , of the Mirlitons , the Volney circle and the Aquarellistes , but there is , so to speak , nothing good in them , it’s as if the men with the power are becoming more and more senile . I hope that your health will continue to be good and that the things that make you worry will disappear .
Warm regards from Jo , be of good heart , and thank you again for your kind letter . Handshake .
Theo
