My dear old Bernard ,
I feel the need to beg your pardon for leaving you so abruptly the other day . Which I therefore do herewith , without delay . I recommend that you read Tolstoy’s Les Légendes Russes , and I’ll also let you have the article on E . Delacroix that I’ve spoken to you about .
I , for my part , did go to Guillaumin’s anyway , but in the evening , and I thought that perhaps you didn’t know his address , which is 13 quai d’Anjou . I believe that , as a man , Guillaumin has sounder ideas than the others , and that if we were all like him we’d produce more good things and would have less time and inclination to be at each other’s throats .
I persist in believing that — not because I gave you a piece of my mind but because it will become your own conviction — I persist in believing that you’ll realize that in the studios not only does one not learn very much as far as painting goes , but not much that’s good in terms of savoir vivre , either .
  And that one finds oneself obliged to learn to live , as one does to paint , without resorting to the old tricks and trompe l’oeil of schemers .
I don’t think your portrait of yourself will be your last , or your best — although all in all it’s frightfully you .
Look here — briefly , what I was trying to explain to you the other day comes down to this . In order to avoid generalities , let me take an example from life .
If you’ve fallen out with a painter , with Signac , for example , and if as a result you say: if Signac exhibits where I exhibit , I’ll withdraw my canvases — and if you run him down , then it seems to me that you’re not behaving as well as you could behave .
Because it’s better to take a long look at it before judging so categorically , and to reflect , reflection making us see in ourselves , when there’s a falling out , as many faults on our own side as in our adversary , and in him as many justifications as we might desire for ourselves .
 
If , therefore , you’ve already considered that Signac and the others who are doing pointillism often make very beautiful things with it —
Instead of running those things down , one should respect them and speak of them sympathetically , especially when there’s a falling out .
Otherwise one becomes a narrow sectarian oneself , and the equivalent of those who think nothing of others and believe themselves to be the only righteous ones .
This extends even to the academic painters , because take , for example , a painting by Fantin-Latour — and above all his entire oeuvre . Well then — there’s someone who hasn’t rebelled , and does that prevent him , that indefinable calm and righteousness that he has , from being one of the most independent characters in existence?
I also wanted to say a word to you about the military service that you’ll be required to do . You must absolutely see to that now .
Directly , in order to inform yourself properly about what one can do in such an event ; first to retain the right to work , to be able to choose a garrison , &amp ; c . But indirectly , by taking care of your health . You mustn’t arrive there
  too anaemic or too agitated if you want to emerge from it stronger .
I don’t see it as a very great misfortune for you that you have to join the army , but as a very grave ordeal , from which , if you emerge from it , you’ll emerge a very great artist . Until then , do all you can to build yourself up , because you’ll need quite a bit of spirit . If you work hard that year , I believe that you may well succeed in having a fair stock of canvases , some of which we’ll try to sell for you , knowing that you’ll need pocket money to pay for models .
I’ll gladly do all I can to make a success of what was started in the dining-room , but I believe that the first condition for success is to put aside petty jealousies ; it’s only unity that makes strength . It’s well worth sacrificing selfishness , the ‘each man for himself’ , in the common interest .
I shake your hand firmly .
Vincent
