Letter|My dear friend Koning ,
Learning from Theo that you’re going back to Holland , I wanted to drop you a line to say farewell .
You must have seen the Impressionists at Durand-Ruel . You’ll have a great deal to tell the fellows in Holland about what you saw in Paris .
I’m very glad that you’re in good health , as Theo wrote to me . We can hardly do without it for the work .
Tomorrow I’m going to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer just to see a blue sea and a blue sky . And just to get an idea of the figures . Because I think that I’ll suddenly make a furious attack on the figure , around which I’m currently circling as if I didn’t care about it , but all the same that’s actually exactly my goal .
 
I’m beginning to get quite tanned . The people here are tanned by the sun , yellow and orange in colour , and sometimes red ochre .
It surprised me somewhat not to have heard whether our exchange went ahead , I hope so .
I’ve just made a drawing even larger than the first two . Of a group of pines on a rock , seen from a hill . Behind that foreground a vista of meadows , a road with poplars and , right in the distance , the town .
The trees very dark against the sunlit meadow .
Perhaps you’ll get a chance to see this drawing . I did it with very thick reed pens on thin Whatman , and used a quill pen for the finer lines in the distance .
  I can recommend that to you , because the lines with a quill pen are more in the nature of those with a reed .
I’m glad you’ve seen my first consignment from here , I hope there’ll be a few seascapes in the next , and then — — — — — the figure .
That’s what I’m chiefly after , only until now walking and working outdoors seemed to me better for my health , and I didn’t want to start a figure until I felt a little stronger .
Well , old chap , I’ll often think about our being together in Paris , and I’m sure we’ll hear from you when you’re back in Holland .
It’s very good that you’re returning hale and hearty .
  If you should come back next year , come and have a look around here too . I wish you could see the colour here .
I’m very curious about the region I’ll see tomorrow , and about the sea .
At present there are bullfights almost every Sunday . Last Sunday a bull jumped over the barrier and he jumped up against the terraces where the spectators were sitting , but the arenas here are so high that it can do no harm . Meanwhile , in a village near here a bull jumped out of the enclosure , made its way through the spectators and injured several of them , then ran through the village . At the end of the village , which is built on a rock , there’s an enormously high , steep cliff . In its rage the bull just kept running and — plunged to its death below .
A hearty handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
