Letter|My dear Theo ,
I felt as you did , in so far as when you write that the work didn’t yet proceed as usual the very first few days , I had the same experience .
They have therefore been days that none of us will forget , and yet the overall impression isn’t terrible but only grave . Life isn’t long for anyone , and the question is just — to do something with it .
The painting went better again today ; the first two heads went wrong — today’s is a head of a young girl , almost a child’s head .
As to colour , it’s a contrast of bright red and pale green against the colour of the little face ; there’s already a head like it among those you took with you . I’d like to hear sometime whether those rolled-up ones arrived safely .
If I thought that C . M . meant it when he asked for heads of children , I could send him this one I did today , but . . . . . I can’t say I feel much inclined to enter into correspondence (unless he asks for something more specifically) .
It can do no harm , though , that he’s been to the studio . I don’t mind starting a new still life of those honesty heads and dry leaves against blue either , because he said something about that too .
Of course I intend to keep working hard , but it’s very necessary for me to square my paint bill as soon as possible . Every other year , I’ve been able to get square at about this time and buy myself some new equipment . And this year I’ve painted so much the last few months that I actually need it more .
I didn’t want to keep talking about it or contradict you much when you were here — but when you said that I would change some day and , no more than Mauve stayed in Bloemendaal for ever , would I stay here for ever either — maybe — but — I don’t see any advantage myself in moving , because I have a good studio here and the countryside here is very beautiful .
 
Don’t forget that I’m definitely convinced that a painter of peasant life can do no better than follow the example of Barbizon – dwelling and living right in the midst of what one is painting , for it’s new and different outside every day .
In short , the two reasons for living in the country are that one can do more work and has fewer expenses .
There are about 3 months , let’s say , between now and the time you come back here in the summer .
If I work hard day after day , I can have another 20 or so studies for you by then , and moreover another twenty or so to take to Antwerp if you want . But — it’s very necessary for me to pay off my paint bill as soon as possible . You know I didn’t say another word to you about it either in February or in March .
But I didn’t have it easy in those months , I can tell you that .
It has become colder again here . As soon as we have a few fine days , I’ll make something of the churchyard .
I think the little head I made today is certainly as good as the one you have with a large white cap , which is something like this[After ‘this’ (dit) Van Gogh drew a little arrow pointing to the sketches]
And could serve as a pendant to it .
If you mount these two on gilded Bristol they might perhaps look good in the gold , do better than by themselves .
Regards , with a handshake , and still thinking often of your visit
Yours truly ,
Vincent
