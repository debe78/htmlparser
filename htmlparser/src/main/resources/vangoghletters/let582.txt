Letter|My dear Theo
I was very pleased to receive your letter and the rough draft of the letter to Tersteeg and the 50-franc note .
Your letter to Tersteeg is perfectly good in the draft , I hope you didn’t spoil it too much when making a fair copy .
It seems to me that your letter to Tersteeg adds to mine — myself , I regretted the state in which I had posted it . Because you’ll have noticed that the idea of getting Tersteeg to take the initiative in introducing the Impressionists to England only came to me when writing the actual letter , and was only partially expressed in a P . S . added afterwards . While in your letter you explain that idea to him more fully . Will he understand? Indeed — it concerns him .
I’ve had a letter here from Gauguin , who says he’s been ill in bed for a fortnight . That he’s broke , since he’s had to pay off some pressing debts . That he’d like to know if you’ve sold anything for him but that he can’t write to you for fear of bothering you . That he’s under so much pressure to earn a little money he’d be determined to reduce the price of his paintings still further .
I can do nothing about this business from my end except write to Russell , which I’ll do this very day .
 
And after all , we’ve already tried to get Tersteeg to buy one . But what can we do , he must really be hard up . I’m sending you a few lines for him in case you have something to tell him , but open letters if any come for me , because you’ll know sooner what’s in them if you do that and that will save me the trouble of telling you what’s in them . This goes once and for all .
Would you risk buying the seascape from him for the firm? If that were possible he would be out of difficulties for the time being .
Now it’s very good that you’ve taken in young Koning , I’m so glad you won’t be living alone in your apartment . In Paris one is always suffering , like a cab-horse , and if on top of that you have to live alone in your stable it would be too much .
About the Independents’ exhibition , do whatever you see fit .
What would you say to showing the two large landscapes of the Butte Montmartre there? It’s all much the same to me ,
  I’m inclined to place slightly more hopes in this year’s work .
There’s a hard frost here , and out in the country there’s still snow — I have a study of a whitened landscape with the town in the background . And then 2 little studies of a branch of an almond tree that’s already in flower despite everything .
Enough for today , I’m writing a note to Koning .
I’m really very pleased that you’ve written to Tersteeg , and I have hopes that this will be the renewal of your relations in Holland .
With a handshake to you and to any pals you may meet .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
