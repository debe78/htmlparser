Letter|My dear Theo ,
Here’s a short note for Bernard and Lautrec , to whom I’d solemnly promised to write . I’m sending it to you so that you can give it to them sometime , it’s not in the least urgent and it will be a reason for you to see what they’re doing and to hear what they’re saying , if you want .
But what’s Tersteeg doing? Nothing? If you haven’t had a reply , I’d drop him a line if I were you , very short and very calm , but stating that you’re astonished that he hasn’t replied to you . I say ‘personally’ , because even though he doesn’t reply to me — to you — HE MUST reply , and you must insist on getting a reply . If you don’t , you’ll lose your self-confidence , and on the contrary , this is an excellent opportunity to gain more . I don’t believe we should press the point in a new letter explaining things again . We have to be careful with him — but what we have to avoid is to let ourselves be treated as if we were dead or outlaws . Enough . Let’s hope that you’ve received his reply in the meantime .
I’ve had a line from Gauguin , who complains about the bad weather , is still unwell and says nothing vexes him more than lack of money among the variety of human ills , and yet he feels doomed to be broke for ever .
 
Rain and wind these past few days , I’ve worked at home on the study of which I’ve made a croquis in Bernard’s letter . My aim was to give it colours like stained glass , and a design of solid outlines .
Am reading Pierre et Jean by Guy de Maupassant . It’s beautiful — have you read the preface explaining the freedom the artist has to exaggerate , to create in a novel a more beautiful , simpler , more consoling nature , and explaining what Flaubert’s phrase might have meant , ‘talent is long patience’ — and originality an effort of will and intense observation?
There’s a Gothic porch here that I’m beginning to think is admirable , the porch of St Trophime , but it’s so cruel , so monstrous , like a Chinese nightmare , that even this beautiful monument in so grand a style seems to me to belong to another world , to which I’m as glad not to belong as to the glorious world of Nero the Roman .
Must I tell the truth and add that the Zouaves , the brothels , the adorable little Arlésiennes going off to make their first communion , the priest in his surplice who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros , the absinthe drinkers , also seem to me like creatures from another world?
  This doesn’t mean I’d feel at home in an artistic world , but it means I prefer to make fun of myself than to feel lonely . And I think I’d feel sad if I didn’t see the funny side of everything .
You’ve had plenty of snow in Paris , from what our friend L’Intransigeant tells us . However , it’s not a bad idea for a journalist to advise General Boulanger to put the secret police off the scent by henceforth wearing rose-tinted spectacles , which in his opinion would go better with the General’s beard . Perhaps this will have the favourable influence we’ve been wanting for so long — on the picture trade .
But nevertheless we’re going to see something of what there is in this famous Mr Tersteeg . He’ll have to come to a decision — really — in the interests of our pals we are , it seems to me , under some obligation not to let ourselves be thought of as dead men . It’s not about us but it’s about the question of the Impressionists in general , so as he has been approached by us , we must have his reply .
You must feel like me that we can’t move forward without having
  positive information about his intentions .
If we think it’s a good idea to create a permanent exhibition of the Impressionists in London and Marseille , it goes without saying that we’ll try to establish them . So it remains to be seen , will Tersteeg be part of it? Yes or no?
And if not , what are his intentions as regards an offensive , do they exist , yes or no? And has he calculated , like us , the effect of a fall on paintings that are highly priced at present , a fall which , it seems to me , will probably come about as soon as the Impressionists rise .
Look at the way those who sell highly priced paintings are harming themselves by opposing , for political reasons , the advent of a school that for years has shown an energy and a perseverance worthy of Millet , Daubigny and others . But let me know if Tersteeg has written to you and what he may have said . I’ll do nothing about this without you . Good luck and a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
