Letter|Dear Sir ,
I looked at your new still lifes with pleasure , particularly the one with a Cologne pot and jar of gherkins . And those two previous ones have also been improved by change to the background . However — nonetheless , in general , in these ones too , the colour in the shaded passages is again still not lively enough , in my view . I wanted to drop you a line to tell you that I’ll try to arrange matters so that I can come and paint with you for 3 days in a row — if you approve . That means we can really tackle this question . Because otherwise I fear that you wouldn’t be able to help getting the same results again every time . So I say , let’s devote 3 days or so to it , because the question of chiaroscuro and colour and deep tone in the shadow is an eternally difficult question . And whether or not a study is painted better or less well — its artistic value — depends to a very considerable extent on the treatment of the shaded passages . I’ll tell you what I feel when looking at your studies as they are now .
 
I’ve soon seen enough , and I’d wish that the shaded passages in particular drew my eye for longer . Were more mysterious .
This shouldn’t surprise you — and you mustn’t take it amiss of me if I repeatedly speak of it — between ourselves .
In order to get the chiaroscuro right , one must not only paint a lot but also really see a great deal being painted , and know some things about theory , about light and colour . I’m sure that once we’ve really painted together again you’ll see for yourself that at the moment you’re still overlooking things which , once you learn to see them , will mean that painting will interest you much more even . In short — there will be even more soul in it .
Well , what I regret about this is that I’m so tied to my models here — I can’t get away as easily as I could in the autumn .
In the winter I can get people to pose whom I can’t get when they have work out in the fields , or only with more difficulty .
 
Anyway , I’m working with almighty pleasure these days , for I would much rather paint figures than anything else . Then — the heads of these women here with the white caps — it’s difficult — but it’s so eternally beautiful . It’s precisely the chiaroscuro — the white and the part of the face in shadow , that has such a fine tone .
I don’t know exactly when I’ll be able to get away for three days or so , but I’ll send you a postcard as soon as I can . I’m coming over for a while on Sunday anyway , and would like to take a metre of that canvas from Baijens with me , since my canvas is used up .
I do foresee , though , that the better you do and the more you progress with your painting , the less pleasure you may experience from it because of certain Eindhoven folk . But at the same time it seems to me that the pleasure of being able to make something amply outweighs certain spiteful criticism . Anyway , the more one paints , the less time and inclination one has to listen to it .
 
Next Sunday I hope to bring you a portfolio of wood engravings in which you’ll find things that will interest you .
Between ourselves — that still life which you framed makes an impression on me of being less correct in the drawing than most of the others . In this respect , that I dare suppose that you neglected sufficiently to compare the proportion of the width of the group as a whole with the height , and consequently the relationship between the objects leaves something to be desired . Measuring , that’s what such a tremendous amount depends on , and if you really pay attention to it at the outset , you’ll save a lot of time later , when there will be the more difficult subjects — such as a head — to make .
I write this to you to assure you , at the start of 85 , that it’s not out of indifference that I haven’t come so much recently , but that on the contrary I consider that if you keep working like this for the whole of the year 85 , you’ll make more progress in one year than many others in 3 years . So with my best wishes for 85 — yours respectfully
Your servant
Vincent
