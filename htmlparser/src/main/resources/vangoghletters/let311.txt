Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
I’ve just received the roll of woodcuts . Many thanks for them . They’re all beautiful .
Heilbuth finer than any of the sheets by him I already have . I remember your remarking to me once on the particularly fine execution of it . Why does this come to mind? — precisely because the execution struck me — as being done in exactly the way that my brother has already written to me about . If you come here sometime I’ll show you on what that’s done , and I think this will rather surprise you , as it does me . And don’t doubt for a moment that you’ll come to understand fully how those effects of grey , white and black are obtained .
The print I’m most pleased with at present is The light of other days by Lucas . Isn’t it just like one of Andersen’s fairy tales? Oh , I find it so beautiful and real . As it happens , I have New Year’s Eve by I don’t know whom , but a German , also a night watchman before a tower hatch in the snow , which is a pendant as it were . And how vigorously engraved it is .
There’s a lot of life in Marchetti , At the weigh-in , resembles Small especially .
I have two curious prints by Gussow . This one with the two old people is good .
That beautiful wretch is enticing . What a contrast in woodcut between the illustrations in that and The light of other days , for example . I already knew several of the figures , because they were adopted by Univers Illustré , I believe . Most were entirely new to me , though , and I find some of them splendid , such as the small figure in white against a tonal brown background of dune or heath , and the walk in the snow too , the old lady in black by the fire . It’s what I would call cosy to a high degree .
They may only be impressions , but they’re fresh . It’s a splendid package , again many sincere thanks .
 
Do you have Snowballing , a large sheet from London News by E . Frère , a school playground with boys? I’ve just got it in duplicate .
At the same time I found a particularly fine large print by Vautier , An arrest .
I long so much for you to come — not just out of selfishness because I long to see you , but also because I’m so firmly convinced that being introduced to the first years of The Graphic , above all , will make an impression on you that will give you ‘complete certainty’ as to the importance of woodcuts . Not that I still believe that you aren’t now very deeply attached to them — on the contrary , I don’t doubt it in the slightest .
But still , there are several prints which you probably don’t know yet and which will make it all even richer and more solid .
It seems to me that if one owns a print and sees it constantly , one comes to find it even more beautiful . I think you know the three Herkomer I’m sending you herewith . But I really want you to have them too .
And — my dear friend — I’ve talked to you a great deal about Pinwell and Walker . Now here for once is a real Walker , first-class quality . Did I overdo my praise of it?
 
Now , without more ado you must accept these and the others that I have in duplicate because of The Graphic . In my view prints like these together form a kind of Bible for an artist , in which he reads now and again to get into a mood . It’s good not only to know them but to have them in the studio once and for all , it seems to me .
I don’t doubt for a moment that when you receive these (unless you already have them) you’ll feel that it’s good to have them , and that one immediately decides one never wants to let go of them .
If you feel greater or lesser pangs of conscience about accepting these and other prints , just consider — do you regret having taken those first ones last year? I think not , for , whether it was because of that or something else , this year your collection has been something that you thought about more than in the past . That’s only to be expected: it’s precisely through having those prints oneself that one thinks about them more and more and the impressions become clear and strong . And so these will have a similar effect , I believe . They’ll increasingly become friends of yours .
Now , for my part I haven’t regretted giving them to you , for you appreciate them and you view them as they should be viewed . There are few who are in sympathy with them , and the fact is that I’ve come to value your friendship precisely because you have an eye and a heart for them , and would find it difficult to do without it .
 
I used to think that most painters felt and thought about art in the same way as you and I , but this isn’t so in this respect .
Well , enough of this . Trust me in this and accept them without more ado . you’ll have more of them when you’ve completely recovered and you come here sometime .
I must say something else to you as regards Irish Emigrants by Holl . The I wrote to you about is , as a type , rather like the central figure in that print , namely the mother with her child on her arm . Taking a broad view , without considering details .
I can give you no better description of .
Now , old chap , get well quickly , write soon , have no scruples about this package , thank you again for yours , a firm handshake in thought .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
