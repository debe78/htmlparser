Letter|My dear Theo ,
Would you read the letter I’ve written to Mr Tersteeg — and would you send it to him with a letter from you if you judge the move is right . You see , for myself I thought we had to make an effort from this end , because we’ll have Reid through Van Wisselingh and Van Wisselingh through Tersteeg . And that’s what you’ll explain to Tersteeg yourself . Fed as I am by you — and as you draw your own income from the firm of Boussod Valadon &amp ; Cie , I don’t want to do anything against the firm . On the contrary , I ask no more than this , that what you’ve started in the shop on the boulevard should last and become more important . But you need support from other employees in the firm . If Tersteeg refuses to get involved in it we still have Reid and Wisselingh as English agents . You know that Van W . has married the daughter of the Glasgow picture dealer who’s in competition with Reid . If Reid takes the Impressionists , if he finds a way of starting up there ,
  and if he tries to do that against the rest of us , from that moment we’re entitled to let his opponent over there know what’s going on . But if Wisselingh ever gets involved , and especially if today or tomorrow you have a chat with W . , Tersteeg could immediately complain: why did you , esteemed employee of our firm , who handles the Impressionists , not tell me what was going on?
So you’ll have to talk to Tersteeg about it first , and to save you the trouble of writing a long letter it is I who have written it this time .
You could add to it by saying something vague about the question of Reid and the Impressionists and the interest that Van Wisselingh may subsequently have , hence the complications of this matter .
And what I’ve said in a postscript , namely that in view of the low prices compared with the interest the paintings present , Tersteeg should easily be able to sell about fifty in Holland , and besides he’ll be obliged to have some , because if people are already talking about them in Antwerp and
  Brussels , they’ll be talking about them in Amsterdam and The Hague too before long .
Anyway , what’s proposed in the letter is by no means unpleasant either for Tersteeg or for you: you’ll show him round all the studios and he’ll see for himself that next year people will be talking a lot and will keep on talking about the new school for a long time . If , though , you think the letter is badly timed you have my full permission to burn it . But if you send it , suggest the same thing to him yourself .
But you’re well aware that Tersteeg is at home in English business matters like a fish in water , and so it’s entirely possible that it’s he who would control the way these new paintings are doing over there . Really , this way Tersteeg and the London would organize the permanent exhibition of the Impressionists in London — you would have the one in Paris and I would start it up in Marseille . But Tersteeg will have to see a lot for himself first , and that’s why a grand tour of the studios is a good idea at this point ; you’ll explain to him the whole importance of the matter as you go round .
The artists’ association is all the more likely to come about since Tersteeg
  won’t be against our having the artists’ interests at heart , nor that above all we want to increase the cost price of a painting , which in fact wouldn’t be saleable if it cost nothing .
In any case , we’ve got to talk about this boldly now , haven’t we — and Mesdag and others have got to stop POKING FUN at the Impressionists . It will be helpful in any case for Tersteeg to be interviewed on this subject .
You see that for myself I still see the crux of the matter in England , either artists will give their work to the dealers over there at miserable prices , or artists will get together and themselves choose intelligent agents who aren’t usurers . Now think the matter over — and send the letter or burn it , as you think best . It’s not a cut and dried thing I want to send you , but I’d very much like to see Tersteeg involved because he has the necessary self-assurance .
I shake your hand firmly .
Vincent
I have one more study .
