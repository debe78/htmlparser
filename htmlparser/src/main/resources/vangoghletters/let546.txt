Letter|My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter and 150 francs enclosed . Wanted to tell you that I’m glad to have come here . I painted 3 more studies last week ; one of the backs of old houses — seen out of my window — two in the park . I’ve exhibited one of them at a dealer’s . Furthermore , I’ve also left what I brought with me from the country with two others on commission . At a fourth I can exhibit a view of the wharf as soon as the weather allows me to paint it , because he had a Mols that he wanted something to show alongside . Furthermore , I got another address from the last of them , where he assured me I’d be well received . Now these dealers aren’t the biggest in Antwerp , but all the same I saw at all of them , among much that I didn’t like , such things as appealed to me , for instance at one a painting by Van Goyen and a study by Troyon , at another a Mols and tiny little Dutch paintings — at another that little painting which I told you was like Raffaëlli — it’s by Moormans — and some good watercolours — at another various good seascapes by young Belgians . I saw very few figures , and I consequently intend to try to paint some figures .
 
The address that the dealer in question gave me is actually that of one of the large dealers (Nicolié) who don’t have a shop window but hold their exhibitions in a private house . I want to take figures there , though .
Then I’ve also discovered useful sources for paint &amp ; c . , where I’ll be able to get things quite cheaply . I’ve also hunted out Linnig , whom you mentioned in the summer when I asked you if you knew people in Antwerp — but he has nothing but a few miserable old paintings ; paints himself rather like Vertin , but seemed to me to be a discouraged man in so far as he ever had any courage , which I reckon wasn’t much . All these gentlemen , though , are complaining bitterly that nothing’s moving . Still , that’s not news . I hope to go and see the painting you write about before long . I’ve been busy going backwards and forwards , though , and still am , tracking down those fellows , and at the same time hunting for models , too . That last is always terribly difficult , but I’ve done it elsewhere and so I’ll manage here too . I have an appointment for tomorrow with a splendid old man — will he come???
 
Today I got my stock of paint that they forwarded to me from Eindhoven and paid for it , more than 50 francs . It’s hard , terribly hard to keep working when people don’t buy , and literally to have to pay for one’s paint out of what wouldn’t be excessive just for food and drink and lodgings alone , living frugally . And on top of that , the models . Anyway . Still , there’s a chance , and a good one even , for there are relatively few people working at present . To my mind they’re only half to blame for this (for the other half they are) because it’s sometimes too tough . And yet they build national museums costing hundreds of thousands and similar things , but meanwhile the artists sometimes starve . But be all this as it may , I needed to look into things for myself , and the chance of doing something isn’t less but rather a great deal more than I’d imagined . I’ve seen various photographs of Jan van Beers’s work . Some of his things are done with a great deal of character . But I imagine that someone like Manet , say , is very much more of a painter than Van Beers , and does it better , more artistically . If only I knew my way around here rather better , if only I could get the models I saw! Yesterday I was in the Scala café concert , something like the Folies Bergères — I thought it was tedious and hackneyed , of course , but — I amused myself looking at the audience .
  There were magnificent women’s heads , really extraordinarily fine , among the worthy bourgeois folk in the back rows , and on the whole I find what they say about Antwerp true indeed , that the women are good-looking here .
Ah! I’ll say it again , if I could only get the models I want! What leaves me quite cold are the mass of German girls , all manufactured from a single model one would say , that one sees at the café concerts . It seems that one sees that same breed everywhere nowadays , like Bavarian beer . It seems to be an article that’s exported in bulk . I’m bored to tears by all these German elements that lurk wherever one goes these days . It’s sure to be just the same in Paris , with the Boches worming their way in everywhere . Anyway , it’s a boring thing to talk about .
Seeing some paintings by other people has given me all sorts of ideas for when I’m back in the country in the spring ; at the same time my confidence to carry on with all the strength at my disposal is being boosted in general . Antwerp is a beautiful colour , and it’s worthwhile for the subjects alone .
One evening I saw a popular dance for sailors &amp ; c . down by the docks — it was quite charming and all very respectable . That won’t be the case at all these dances , though . No one there was drunk , for instance , nor did anyone drink much .
 
There were very good-looking girls there , the best-looking of whom was ugly . I mean , a figure that struck me like an amazingly beautiful Jordaens or Velázquez or — Goya — was one in black silk , probably some inn landlady or other , with an ugly and irregular face , but with vivacity and piquancy à la Frans Hals . She danced excellently in an old-fashioned manner — among others , once with a well-to-do little farmer type who had a large green umbrella under his arm , even while he was waltzing amazingly fast . Other girls were wearing ordinary jackets and skirts and red scarves — the sailors , cabin-boys &amp ; c . , quite charming . Retired ship’s captain types who came to watch . Extraordinarily authentic . It does one good to see people who are really enjoying themselves .
Well , you can see that I’m not sitting idle — but I can’t stress enough how terribly difficult it is to be short of money . My best chance is in figures because there are relatively very few who do it , and I must make the most of this chance . I have to work my way in here , until I come into contact with good figure painters — Verhaert , for instance , and then portrait painting , I imagine , will be the way to earn something for grander things .
 
I feel a power to do something within me . I see that my work holds its own against other work , and that gives me an incredible desire to work ; and lately , when I was in the country , I was starting to have doubts precisely because I noticed that Portier seemingly doesn’t care for it any more .
I’d be able to do more if I were better off . But I’m partly dependent on my purse as far as production is concerned .
I also have an idea for a sort of shop sign that I hope to carry out . I mean , for instance , still lifes of fish for a fishmonger , for flowers , for vegetables , for a restaurant . It seems to me that if one took well-arranged subjects — large — 1 metre by 1/2 a metre or 3/4 , say , a canvas like that would cost me 50 francs , no more — even 30 francs with luck , and it would be worth trying to make a few .
This much is certain , I want to be seen — we may have to lose heart later ,
  but we’ll manage to put it off for a long while .
Do write to me again if you have time . The end of the month would certainly be hard unless you can give me a little support then . For me , so much may depend on my being able to stick to my guns .
And one can’t afford to look hungry or wretched . On the contrary , one must see to it that one helps to liven things up .
Regards , with a handshake .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
