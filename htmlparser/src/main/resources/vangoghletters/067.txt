My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter , write to me often , as I long for it these days . Write in more detail , too , and about everyday things ; you see that I , too , am doing that more and more . I was interested to hear what you said about Boks , how he has arranged his studio and that you go there quite a lot . Do keep me well informed .
We sometimes feel rather lonely and long for friends , and think we’d be quite different and happier if only we found ‘it’ , a friend of whom we would say , ‘this is it’ . But you , too , will already have started to notice that there’s a lot of self-deception behind this , and that this longing , if we were to surrender to it too much ,
  would cause us to stray from the path . There are words that keep haunting me these days , they are the text for today: ‘His children shall seek to please the poor . ’
And now for some news , namely that my friend Gladwell is going to move . One of the employees at the printer’s has persuaded him to come and live with him ; he had already tried to do this before . Gladwell has done it , I believe , without thinking . I’m awfully sorry he’s going . It will be soon now , probably at the end of this month .
For a few days now we’ve had a mouse in our ‘cabin’ ; that’s what we call our room , you know . Every evening we put some bread out , and it already knows how to find it .
I read the advertisements in the English newspapers and have already written to a couple , we’re hoping for a godsend . And now , regards to everyone at Rooses’ and to any others who might ask after me , and do write again soon . Adieu . Ever ,
Your loving brother
Vincent
If Mr Tersteeg should speak to you about me , write and tell me . Give my regards to His Hon . every time I write to you .
