My dear friend ,
I’m really happy to have received good news of you and to learn that you have set to work again .
As I told you in my hasty card , I’ve settled in Cassis , a pretty little port an hour from Marseille . Some white , some blue , some orange harmonically dispersed in pretty undulations . All around mountains with
  rhythmic curves .
I’m giving myself a great deal of trouble . Should I manage to render a tenth of what I see , I’d be most content .
Our Veronese Green and our cobalt blue – not that of that good fellow Tanguy – are without doubt shit beside these Mediterranean waves .
I’m much hindered by the weather: rain or mistral for several days . I’m taking advantage of this setback to do the plates of a work that was ordered from me
  in collaboration with Mr C . Henry (perhaps you’ve read certain of my collaborator’s articles in the Revue Indépendante) by the Librairie de l’Art .
It’s a book on the aesthetics of shapes , whose measurements and angles can be studied by means of an instrument – C . Henry’s aesthetic protractor . One then sees if the shape is harmonious or not .
This will have a great social bearing , above all from the point of view of industrial art . We’re teaching the art of seeing correctly and beautifully to apprentice workmen etc . whose aesthetic education has only been conducted up to now
  by means of empirical formulae and dishonest or silly advice . I’ll send you one of these brochures when they’ve seen the light of day .
Why don’t you come to do a study or two in this pretty country?
Good news of you very often , eh?
Cordial handshakes .
P . Signac
