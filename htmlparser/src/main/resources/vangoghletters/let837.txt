Letter|My dear ,
A few lines to tell you that I’m very pleased that you’re in Paris with Theo and Jo. And no need to tell you that I think of all of you every day.
Fortunately, a quite violent attack of exaltation or delirium is again behind me and I don’t feel any after-effects, so to speak, I am as I am every day.
And I’m going to begin work again first thing tomorrow if the weather permits. Today we have a very mild day with a spring sun, one would say. And yesterday while out walking I saw dandelions already in flower in the meadows, which will be shortly followed by the daisies and violets. I find the winter very beautiful here and absolutely the same thing as in the north, only a bit brighter.
 
Yesterday I sent some paintings to Paris – and the one of the women picking olives I designated for you and Mother. You’ll see, I think, that in a white frame it takes on quite a soft colour effect, the opposition of the pink and the green.
Soon I’ll send a few more that are drying at the moment, some more mountains, and a view of the garden here with tall pines
I shan’t write any more to you today because the letter must go off. I’m very glad that you’re there, and I hope that the great event will pass happily for Jo.
More soon.
Ever yours,
Vincent.
