My dear Theo ,
Want to make sure you get a few lines again soon , yesterday a good letter from Etten from which I understood that you had already been there and are expected back on Saturday evening , to spend Sunday at home as well . So you’re probably there now too , and it will be a good Sunday .
Was at the early service this morning (Noorderkerk) , afterwards walked around town a bit , the canals are especially beautiful now that the leaves on the trees have the colours of autumn , and then went to the English church and heard a very good sermon on ‘Take no thought (for your life) saying , What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things . But seek ye first the Kingdom of God , and His righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you , Take therefore no thought for the morrow , for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof’ . And he also spoke of the preceding ‘Behold the fowls of the air’ and Consider the lilies of the field . There was a fairly large and pleasant congregation . I’m very fond of that little church , and many a person there probably recalls things and places that aren’t unfamiliar to me either .
Have you ever seen or read the book by Esquiros , La vie Anglaise (or L’Angleterre et la vie Anglaise?)? I haven’t , but I think it must be an interesting book .
If you have the time and the inclination , think of that piece by Jules Breton , and that other one by Michelet .
Uncle Jan is going to Leiden tomorrow , from there to Middelburg , and will in all likelihood also go briefly to Princenhage , where Pa may well meet Uncle .
Did you have a good trip? Write a few lines soon , it was a wonderful surprise when you came here that evening . (NB: the woman at the station had been slightly surprised at our hasty departure . ) It was nice that we saw Mauve there . Coming back home , I sat up working for a long time . That was a week ago already , the days fly by .
 
How beautiful that engraving after Ary Scheffer is , The holy women at the tomb of Christ , I’m so pleased to have it , especially that old woman , that’s it .
Did you happen to pick up anything for your scrapbook en route? Do continue with it , for it’s a very good thing .
This morning I saw the Minister of the Navy , Taalman Kip , who paid Uncle a visit and took coffee here . How much character there is in that face and in those grey eyes , His Excellency immediately reminded me of old Mr Goupil , or someone like Guizot . It’s good to remember such faces , because it’s food for the soul . I don’t know why , but I’ve been thinking the whole week of that painting and the etching after it of ‘A young citizen of the year V’ by Jules Goupil . I saw the painting in Paris , indescribably beautiful and unforgettable . All those French paintings about the days of the Revolution , such as The Girondists and Last victims of the terror and Marie Antoinette by Delaroche and Muller , and that Young citizen and other paintings by Goupil , and then Anker and so many others , what a beautiful whole they form with many books , such as those by Michelet and Carlyle and also Dickens (Tale of two cities) . In all of that combined there’s something of the spirit which is that of the Resurrection and the Life , which shall live though it seems dead , for it is not dead , but it sleepeth .
I’d so much like to read a lot , but I may not , though actually I needn’t yearn for it , for all things are in the words of Christ — more perfect and more glorious than in any other words . That etching by Jules Goupil hung for a very long time in my room in London in the days when I was very wrapped up in Michelet and other French writers , I believe Harry Gladwell has that etching now . Had a short letter from him since his return to Paris , would like to walk with him again on a day like today in the twilight along the Seine by Notre-Dame . Paris is so enchantingly beautiful in the autumn , and that spot not the least so . How beautiful the winter chrysanthemums in London will be in the little gardens , and they bloom there the whole winter long .
 
Are you planning to read any books in particular this winter , ‘cost what it may’? Sometimes it’s good to persevere and get on with it . Uncle Jan has also read a lot , and there are very many things in him . A like-mindedness and devotion and love like that between Pa and Uncle , that is good fruit of life , and even if that holy fire smoulders now and then because of worries and daily things , sometimes it flares up , bright and dazzling and glorious . As , for instance , that evening last winter when those two went to Hoeven together .
The top of Mount Hekla is white with the snow ,
But inside its fire through the ages doth glow ,
O Thou , though with winter on thy greying head ,
Love , God’s own flame , in the heart is not dead .
We have certainly seen what that means and we do know something about it . Such a fire of Spirit and Love is a Power of God against the dark and evil and terrible things of the world and the dark side of life , it is a power of the Resurrection stronger than death , and a light of hope that gives an awareness and an assurance in the depths and in the secret recesses of the heart , the expression of which are the words , which are simple but say much: I never despair .
Now , old boy , I still have to work and must stop , I wish you well , be blessed , and may God give you and me and all of us the life that is more than meat , the life of doing God’s Word . Just look in art and in books and see whether you might find something , for it is written , Seek and ye shall find , and: If any of you is in need of wisdom , let him ask of God . And that we need . How is Caroline? Give them my regards , and to your housemates too , and to Mauve and Mr Tersteeg if the occasion arises .
In thought a hearty handshake , and believe me
Your loving brother
Vincent
The portrait of Johan van Gogh bears some resemblance to that Young Citizen .
It , too , reminds me again of ‘sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing’ , those words are perceivable in many things .
 
Regards from Uncle Jan too .
