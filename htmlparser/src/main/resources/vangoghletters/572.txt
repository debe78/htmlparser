Letter|My dear friend ,
I thank you for your letter and for what it contained .
I feel sad that even if successful , painting won’t bring in what it costs .
I was touched by what you wrote about home – ‘they’re doing quite well , but it’s sad to see them nevertheless’ . But a dozen years ago or so one would have sworn that the family would continue to prosper after all , and that things would work out well . It would please our greatly if your marriage came off , and for your health and business affairs you shouldn’t remain single anyway .
Myself — I feel I’m losing the desire for marriage and children , and at times I’m quite melancholy to be like that at 35 when I ought to feel quite differently . And sometimes I blame this damned painting .
 
It was Richepin who said somewhere
the love of art makes us lose real love .
I find that terribly true , but on the other hand real love puts you right off art .
And sometimes I already feel old and broken , but still sufficiently in love to stop me being enthusiastic about painting .
To succeed you have to have ambition , and ambition seems absurd to me . I don’t know what will come of it . Most of all , I’d like to be less of a burden to you — and that’s not impossible from now on . Because I hope to make progress in such a way that you’ll be able to show what I’m doing , with confidence , without compromising yourself .
And then I’m going to retreat to somewhere in the south so as not to see so many painters who repel me as men .
You can be sure of one thing , and that’s that I won’t try to do any more work for the Tambourin . I think it’s going to change hands , too , and of course I’m not against that .
 
As far as Miss Segatori is concerned , that’s another matter altogether , I still feel affection for her and I hope she still feels some for me .
But now ’s in an awkward position , she’s neither free nor mistress in her own house , and most of all , she’s sick and ill . Although I wouldn’t say so in public — I’m personally convinced she’s had an abortion (unless of course she had a miscarriage) — whatever the case , in her situation I wouldn’t blame her .
In two months she’ll be better , I hope , and then perhaps she’ll be grateful that I didn’t bother her .
Mind you , if were to refuse in good health and in cold blood to give me back what’s mine , or did me any kind of harm , I wouldn’t be easy on her — but that won’t be necessary .
But I know her well enough still to trust her .
 
And there again , if manages to keep her place going , from the commercial point of view I wouldn’t blame her for preferring to be the one who eats and not the one who gets eaten . If she stepped on my toes a bit in order to succeed — if need be — she has carte blanche .
When I saw her again didn’t hurt my feelings , which she would have done if she was as nasty as people say she is .
I saw Tanguy yesterday and he put a canvas I had just done in his window , I’ve done four since you left , and I have a big one on the go . I’m well aware that these big , long canvases are hard to sell , but in time people will see that there’s open air and good cheer in them . Now the whole lot will make a decoration for a dining room or a house in the country .
And if you really fell in love and then got married , I wouldn’t think it impossible that you too might manage to get hold of a house in the country , like so many other picture dealers . If you live well you spend more , but you also gain more ground , and perhaps these days we do better if we look rich than if we look hard up . It’s better to have fun than to kill yourself . Warm regards to all at home .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
