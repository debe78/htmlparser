Letter|My dear friend Rappard ,
I still wanted to write again while you’re travelling . Thanks for the consignment of books . I would like to apply to Zola’s Mes haines Zola’s own words about Hugo , ‘I should like to demonstrate that , given such a man on such a subject , the result could not be another book than the one it is’ , also Zola’s own words on the same occasion: ‘I shall not cease to repeat , the criticism of this book , as it has been made , seems to me a monstrous injustice’ .
I would truly like to begin by saying that I’m not one of those who blame Zola for this book . Through it I’m getting to know Zola , I’m getting to know Zola’s weak side — insufficient understanding of painting — prejudices instead of correct judgement in this special case . But , my dear friend , should I get irritated with a friend on account of a fault in him? — far from it . On the contrary , he is all the dearer to me because of his fault . So I read the articles about the Salon with a most curious feeling . I think it utterly wrong , entirely mistaken , except in part the appreciation of Manet — I too think Manet is clever — but very interesting , Zola on art , interesting in the same way as , for instance , a landscape by a figure painter: it isn’t his genre , it’s superficial , incorrect , but what an approach — not carried through — so be it — not quite clear — so be it — but at any rate it makes one think and is original and tingling with life . But it’s mistaken and most incorrect , and rests on shifting sands .
Most interesting to hear him on Erckmann-Chatrian . Here he doesn’t lash out so wildly as when he talks about paintings , and his criticism is sometimes deuced telling . I permit him with pleasure to accuse Erckm . -C . of mixing a measure of egotism into his morality . Furthermore , he’s right to say that Erckm . becomes a simpleton when he starts describing Parisian life and that he isn’t familiar with it . A question , however , inevitably raised by this criticism: is Zola familiar with the Alsace , and if he were , wouldn’t he take more interest in Erckmann’s characters , who are as fine as Knaus and Vautier?
 
As for the grain of egotism in most of the characters whose side Erckm . appears to choose , in the old Rabbi David and in Wagner and in Thérèse , I believe the somewhat egotistical Erckmann-Chatrian becomes sublime , and so for me he is extraordinary .
What Zola has in common with Balzac is that he knows little about painting . I think two artist types in Zola’s works , Claude Lantier in Le ventre de Paris and one in Thérèse Raquin , are just like pale ghosts of Manet , Impressionists of a sort . Anyway . Well , Balzac’s painters are awfully heavy going , very tiresome .
Now I’d like to carry on talking about this but I’m no critic . But I’m glad , I just wanted to add , that he scores a hit on Taine , who deserves it because he’s sometimes irritating with his mathematical analysis . Still , through that he (Taine) arrives at curiously deep pronouncements . For example , I read a remark of his — about Dickens and Carlyle ‘the essence of the English character is the absence of happiness . ’ Now I don’t want to insist on the greater or lesser accuracy , but just say that such words are evidence of very deep reflection , looking into the darkness with one’s eyes until one sees something more in it where others no longer see anything . I find that remark beautiful , extraordinarily beautiful , and it says more to me than a thousand other remarks on the subject , and in this case Taine deserves our respect .
Well , am glad to be able to look at the Boughton – Abbey at my leisure for once . I think In the potato field is the finest of all , and the Bellringers by Abbey .
Text a little dry , a little too full of stories about hotels and antique dealers — read it with pleasure . Why? For the same reason as the book by Zola . Because of the personality of the man who wrote it .
Have you noticed that Zola doesn’t even mention Millet? Yet I read a description by Zola of a country graveyard and a deathbed and funeral of an old peasant , which was as beautiful as if they were Millets . So this omission is probably a question of not being familiar with M . ’s work .
 
I can tell you that I’ve found an uncommonly beautiful print by T . Green , the brother or something of C . G . It’s a party at the Foundling Hospital in London , a sort of orphan girls at the table . Oh , you’ll be in raptures over it .
Also by him a smaller ‘A city congregation’ , so delicately drawn , as exquisitely done as Braemar by our friend J . McL . R .
I found two more prints , The ascent of Mount Vesuvius and A game of football by this sphinx J . McL . R . , whose name we’ve so far been unable to decipher but whom I assume to be a brother or at least a relative of W . M . Ridley . Both good , but not as beautiful as the Braemar coach . I also know a salmon fishers , by him and I have a ‘volunteers in the camp’ — the latter print enlightened me about the name .
Furthermore , a procession of monks in the snow by A . Hunt , as fine as a Legros . London Bridge and emigrants by W . M . Ridley , two markets by Buckman , drawn particularly broadly and boldly effective .
By Barnard , Hampstead Heath — First to come — Last to go . How the poor live .
By Hopkins , Children at the beach , very fine in tone ; a beautiful sheet by Millais himself , Xmas stories .
By Birket Foster , Winter landscapes , Christmas time , very cosy , two important Gavarni of the highest quality , Porters of the market , Women of the market and The New Year’s presents .
Then Régamey — beautiful Japanese subjects and a very large print by him , a masterpiece , The diamond field , and another large composition too , The fatted ox .
And by M . F . a sheet of about medium size showing the treadmill in a prison , as beautiful as a Régamey .
By I don’t know whom , a splendid thing about the steel mills in Sheffield called ‘The Fork-grinders’ . It’s in the manner of Edmond Morin , namely his most compact and concise manner .
As you see , this isn’t all that many , but they’re all beautiful things which I consider valuable additions .
By Howard Pyle , a very beautiful female figure . By S . Read , fine landscapes too .
Yet more perhaps , but these are about the most important .
 
How are you getting on with drawing on your travels , if you’ve already left?
I’m working on the potato grubbers , also have a single figure of an old man and several rough studies of figures from the time of the potato harvest . A weed burner and a chap with a sack and one with a wheelbarrow &amp ; c . When you return from your travels I hope you go ahead with your visit quickly .
Then I also have another sower , perhaps the seventh or eighth figure I’ve done for it .
This time I’ve placed him in the space for once , in a large field with clods of earth and a sky .
I’d like to put to Zola the question that I’d like to put to some other people . Tell me , is it true that there’s no distinction between , say , a red ochre dish with a cod on it and , say , the figure of a digger or a sower? Is there or is there not a distinction between Rembrandt and Van Beijeren (just as gifted technically) , between Vollon and Millet?
Have you already noticed that new magazine Pictorial News? Sometimes there are good things in it , but most aren’t very special .
My dear friend , I wish we could spend a little more time together . But what can one do? Write again when you have the time and the inclination . The summer issues of The Graphic and London News aren’t particularly special in my view . The Graphic does , though , have a fine Caldecott , that’s the best thing . And several Reinhart , not the best . London News , Caton Woodville again .
You’ll find the sheets I’m writing to you about more interesting . Diamond field by Régamey isn’t at all gripping at first sight , but one finds it more and more beautiful with time . The T . Green are masterpieces .
My brother writes to me about a particularly beautiful exhibition in Paris , called ‘The hundred masterpieces’ . Adieu , my dear friend , have a good journey , remember to write if there’s time .
With a handshake .
Ever yours ,
Vincent
