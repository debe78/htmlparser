Letter|My dear Theo ,
Since I wrote to you I’m feeling better , and whilst I don’t know if it’ll last I don’t want to wait any longer to write to you again .
Thanks once again for that beautiful etching after Rembrandt . I’d very much like to get to know the painting and know in which period of his life he painted it . All this goes with the Rotterdam portrait of Fabritius , the traveller in the La Caze gallery , into a special category in which the portrait of a human being is transformed into something luminous and consoling .
And how very different this is from Michelangelo or Giotto , although the latter however comes close to it , and Giotto thus forms a sort of possible hyphen between the school of Rembrandt and the Italians .
Yesterday I started working again a little – a thing I see from my window – a field of yellow stubble which is being ploughed , the opposition of the purplish ploughed earth with the strips of yellow stubble , background of hills .
 
Work distracts me infinitely better than anything else , and if I could once really throw myself into it with all my energy that might possibly be the best remedy .
The impossibility of having models , a heap of other things , prevent me from managing it however . Anyway , I really must try to take things a little passively and be patient .
I often think of our in Brittany , who are certainly doing better work than I am . If , with the experience I’m having at present , it was possible for me to begin again , I wouldn’t go and look around the south .
Were I independent and free , I would nevertheless have retained my enthusiasm , for there are some really beautiful things to do .
Such as the vineyards , the fields of olive trees . If I had confidence in the management here , nothing would be better and simpler than to put all my furniture here at the hospital and quietly continue . If I were to recover , or in the intervals , I could sooner or later come back to Paris or Brittany for a time . But first they’re very expensive here , and then I’m afraid of the other patients at the moment . Anyway , a heap of reasons mean that I don’t think I’ve been lucky here either .
I’m perhaps exaggerating in the sadness I feel at being knocked down by illness again – but I feel a kind of fear . You’ll tell me what I tell myself too , that the fault must be inside me and not in the circumstances or other people . Anyway , it isn’t fun .
 
Mr Peyron has been kind to me and he has long experience , I shan’t scorn what he says or considers good .
But will he have a firm opinion , has he written anything definite to you?? And possible?
You can see that I’m still in a very bad mood , it’s because things aren’t going well . Then I consider myself imbecilic to go and ask doctors for permission to make paintings . Besides , it’s to be hoped that if I recover sooner or later , up to a certain point it’ll be because I’ve cured myself by working , which fortifies the will and consequently allows these mental weaknesses less hold .
My dear brother , I wanted to write to you better than this , but things aren’t going very well . I have a great desire to go into the mountains to paint for whole days , I hope they’ll allow me to in the coming days .
You’ll soon see a canvas of a hut in the mountains which I did under the influence of that book by Rod . It would be good for me to stay on a farm for a while , at least I might do some good work there .
I must write to Mother and to Wil in the next few days . Wil asked to be sent a painting , and I’d very much like to give one to Lies as well on the same occasion , who doesn’t have any yet as far as I know .
What do you say about Mother going to live in Leiden? I think she’s right in this sense , that I can understand that she’s pining for her . And then there’ll be none of us left in Brabant .
Speaking of that – not very long ago in Arles I was reading a book , I can’t remember which one , by Henri Conscience . It’s excessively sentimental if you like , what with his peasants , but speaking of Impressionism do you know that it
  contains descriptions of landscape with colour notes of accuracy , feeling and primitiveness of the first order . And it’s always like that . Ah my dear brother , those heaths in the Kempen were something though . But anyway , that won’t come back , and onward we go .
He – Conscience – described a brand-new little house with a bright red slate roof in the full sunshine , a garden with dock and onions , potatoes with dark foliage , a beech hedge , a vineyard , and further on the pine trees , the broom all yellow . Don’t be afraid , it wasn’t like a Cazin , it was like a Claude Monet . Then there’s originality even in the excess of sentimentality .
And as for me , who feels it and can’t damned well do anything , isn’t that sickening .
If you get opportunities for lithographs of Delacroix , Rousseau , Diaz &amp ; c . , ancient and modern artists , Galeries modernes &amp ; c . , I can’t advise you too strongly to hold onto them , for you’ll see that they’ll become rare . Yet it was really the way to popularize beautiful things , those 1-franc sheets of those days , those etchings &amp ; c . back then . Very interesting the Rodin – Claude Monet brochure . How I’d have liked to see that . Pointless to say that nevertheless I don’t agree when he says that Meissonier is nothing and that T . Rousseau isn’t much . Meissoniers and Rousseaus are something highly interesting for those who like them and try to discover what the artist was feeling . It isn’t possible for everyone to be of that opinion , because one has to have seen and looked at them , and you don’t find that on every corner . Now a Meissonier , if you look at it for a year there’s still enough in it to look at the next year , never fear . Not to mention that he’s a man who had his days of happiness , of perfect finds . Certainly I know , Daumier , Millet , Delacroix have another way of drawing – but Meissonier’s execution ,
  that something essentially French above all , although the old Dutchmen would find nothing to fault in it , and yet it’s something other than them and it’s modern ; one has to be blind to believe that Meissonier isn’t an artist and – one of the first rank .
Have many things been done that give the note of the 19th century better than the portrait of Hetzel? When Besnard did those two very beautiful panels , primitive man and modern man , which we saw at Petit’s , in making the modern man a reader he had the same idea .
And I’ll always regret that in our times people believe in the incompatibility of the generation of , say , 48 and the present one . I myself believe that the two hold their own all the same , though I can’t prove it .
Let’s take good Bodmer for example . Was he not able to study nature as a hunter , a savage , did he not love it and know it with experience of an entire long manly life – and do you think that the first Parisian to come along who goes to the suburbs knows as much or more about it because he’ll do a landscape with harsher tones? Not that it’s bad to use pure and clashing tones , not that from the point of view of colour I’m always an admirer of Bodmer , but I admire and I like the man who knew all the forest of Fontainebleau , from the insect to the wild boar and from the stag to the lark . From the tall oak and the lump of rock to the fern and the blade of grass .
Now a thing like that , not anyone who wants to can feel it or find it .
 
And Brion – oh a maker of Alsatian genre paintings people will tell me . That’s fine , he has indeed done the Engagement meal , the Protestant wedding &amp ; c . which are indeed Alsatian . When no one is up to illustrating Les Misérables , he however does it in a manner unsurpassed up to now , and he isn’t mistaken in his types . Is it a small thing to know people so well , the humanity of that period , so well that one scarcely makes a mistake in expression and type?
Ah – the rest of us would have to get old working hard , and that’s why we then get despondent when things don’t go right .
I think that if you see the Bruyas museum in Montpellier one day , I think that then nothing will move you more than Bruyas himself , when one realizes from his purchases what he sought to be for artists . It’s a little disheartening when one sees from certain portraits of him how heartbroken and obviously frustrated his face is . If one doesn’t succeed in the south there still remains he who suffered all his life for that cause .
The only serene portraits are the Delacroix and the Ricard .
For example , by a great chance the one by Cabanel is accurate and most interesting as an observation , at least it gives an idea of the man .
 
I’m pleased that Jo’s has come to Paris . Next year it will perhaps be a little different and you’ll have a child , and that brings a fair few petty vexations of human life – but as certain great miseries of spleen etc . will disappear for ever , that’s certainly how it should go .
I’ll write to you again soon , I’m not writing to you as I would have wished , I hope that all is well at your place and will continue to go well . Am very , very pleased that Rivet has rid you of the cough , which really worried me a bit too .
What I had in my throat is starting to disappear , I’m still eating with some difficulty , but anyway it has got better .
Good handshake to you and to Jo .
Ever yours ,
Vincent .
