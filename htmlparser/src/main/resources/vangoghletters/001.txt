Letter|The Hague , 29 September 1872 .
My dear Theo ,
Thanks for your letter , I was glad to hear that you got back safely . I missed you the first few days , and it was strange for me not to find you when I came home in the afternoon .
We spent some pleasant days together , and actually did go for some walks and see a thing or two whenever we had the chance .
What terrible weather , you must feel anxious on your walks to Oisterwijk . Yesterday there were trotting races on the occasion of the exhibition , but the illumination and fireworks were postponed because of the bad weather , so it’s just as well you didn’t stay to see them . Regards from the Haanebeeks and the Rooses . Ever ,
Your loving
Vincent
